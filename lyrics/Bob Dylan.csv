""we'll meet again someday. on the avenue"". tangled up in blue. . i had a job in the great north woods. working as a cook for a spell. but i never did like it all that much. and one day the ax just fell. so i drifted down to new orleans. where i lucky was to be employed. working for a while on a fishing boat. right outside of delacroix. but all the while i was alone. the past was close behind. i seen a lot of women. but she never escaped my mind. and i just grew. tangled up in blue. . she was working in a topless place. and i stopped in for a beer. i just kept looking at the side of her face. in the spotlight, so clear. and later on, when the crowd thinned out. i was just about to do the same. she was standing there, in back of my chair. said to me ""don't i know your name?"". i muttered something underneath my breath. she studied the lines on my face. i must admit, i felt a little uneasy. when she bent down to tie the laces. of my shoe. tangled up in blue. . she lit a burner on the stove. and offered me a pipe. ""i thought you'd never say hello"" she said.
