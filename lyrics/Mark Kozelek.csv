Sun Kil Moon,Stranger Than Paradise,Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood,2017,"may, 2016. los angeles. checked into the hotel cecil yesterday. i was given a key for a room on the fifteenth floor. and i checked into it. it surprised me as i had heard the higher floors were for. residents only. as of may this year, according to the guy at the desk anyhow it's actually the second and third floors, so he told me. i had read that richard ramirez stayed on the fourteenth floor and of course. i asked about it. but the clerk said nobody knew the specifics on the room in which stayed and i said, ""ah shit."". fifteen was the very top floor, right under the water tanks where a body was supposedly found. i took the room and immediately walked around the hallways and noticed fire escapes all throughout. building going from the bottom to the top had easy access to the roof. the fire escape. that was of course if a fire. you aren't afraid. the noise from the streets was so overbearing that i asked for a room on the other side of the hall. they said they got a room on the fourteenth floor if i didn't mind. and i said, ""no, not at all."". so i took it and i guess it was on what you call the courtyard side of the building. but there was the loudest thud coming from somewhere keeping me up and after (thud, thud, thud). much exploring. it was a elevator motor so all the other floors i went roaming. i found the lower the floor the quieter the motor. they gave me a room on the fourth floor but i didn't take the room without getting a photo of my fourteenth guest floor door. and i finally fell asleep and when i woke up i went for a little walk. that morning. i'm walking around la. walking around downtown la. and the sun is shining today. for pushing 50, i'm doing great. i'm walking around la. walking around downtown la. and the sun is shining today. for pushing 50, i'm feeling great. saw richard edson parking his bike. saw richard edson parking his bike. i said, ""i like your acting in spike lee's do the right thing."". i said, ""i like your acting in spike lee's do the right thing. and jarmusch's stranger than paradise. and your liner notes on the sonic youth reissue"". then i said, ""hey, it was very nice to meet you"". an interesting thing to know in regards to the cecil. there are two elevator doors in the lobby and two up above. on the mezzanine level. but in the famous footage that you see of the girl there's definitely an elevator door on the guest room hallway. 'cause when you step out of the door to go to your room you see the white comms that were right in front of her and the wooden panel that goes sideways. the amount of the activity in the lobby and the elevators in that hotel was more than any in all my years of world traveling. the amount of staff members and maids and maintenance workers roaming around that place was totally mind boggling. at all times young, foreign tourists were lined up at the front desk. as long as lines you'd see at a busy, big city post office. would i say it'd be easy to snatch up a girl and drag her up onto the roof in a 700-room place like that?. fuck yes. would i say she could have been invited up there by a group of people to check out the view? yes. would i say she could have been pulled into one of the multiple shared bathrooms and choked out then dragged up and dumped into a shark tank?. fuck yes. would i say that she could have easily went up there all on her own and went for a swim? yes. would i believe even more a kid pulled a prank and is sitting back on a love in the soap opera? yes. 'cause i see no evidence to support her death besides. vague news reports. and one photo of what were allegedly her parents showing up. at the lax airport. talk of losses but no legal documents have i ever seen to support it. no lawyers speaking on behalf of the alleged lams and no friends who ever spoke on elisa's behalf. i asked a parking lot attendant who had been working there for ten years. ""when that girl was found dead up there in 2013, were you here?"". she said, ""ah, i don't believe no girl up there ever even died."". i said, ""me either but can i ask why you think that, if you don't mind?"". she said, ""you know how a little thing is said and gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger?"". and i said, ""yes."". and she said, ""i think that's what happened next door."". i was completely with her. caroline picked me up and i told her everything that happened. she said, ""cool, glad you got that out of your system. now let's go check into a real hotel down the street. and get down to manhattan beach and say hi to cameron. we're driving the 1-10, gonna say hi to a friend. spend the day on his tv set and show some love and respect. we're driving the 1-10 and we stop for italian food. and saying hi to cameron. thought that we're doing right and good. we talked about bowie at length and he introduced me to luke wilson. and he said he liked my bass playing in stillwater. and i said i liked you in vacancy and bottle rocket. and we talked about james caan and the godfather. and cat stevens songs and steve miller. he said, ""man, i hope we get to work together."". i said, ""man, that would be great. it was nice to meet you."". we left the set and drove back downtown the biltmore. as i feel asleep the mystery of elisa lam was still on my mind. like what was i, some fucking investigator?. and she was real and for whatever reason her body was found in that water. i'm sorry for the parents and their poor, young daughter. i'm sorry for your loss, this world can be a real. pile of shit. but i'm counting my blessed tonight, baby. 'cause we're both healthy and alive. so let's embrace it. went off to the studio in sherman oaks. laid down a few new tracks. took a break, a peruvian restaurant down the street and thought. the ceviche was the best i ever had. i told nathan it was time for me to get on my flight back to san. francisco. but wow, what a great weekend and.... on the way to long beach today. we stopped along the way. to see her brother and say hey. to his family and the kids spraying. each other with hoses in the yard. and i thought about when i was young. and how the yard was so much fun. oh, i thought about when i was young. at the long beach airport, waiting for the flight to san francisco. said i like this airport, it's not too fucking big enough. at the long beach airport. waiting for a flight to san francisco. i said, ""caroline, thanks for coming down. i love you."". she said, ""i had a good time and i love you too.""",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-stranger-than-paradise-lyrics,0.152,0.789,0.06,0.94,0.546
Sun Kil Moon,Butch Lullaby,Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood,2017,"beautiful may day. just back from the house. checked on the roof. got a call that an old friend died. his name was butch. he was tough as nails. you couldn't kill him if you tried. he was tough as an ox but there on the floor he died. next to a 40. and a hot plate. next to the sound of a band rehearsing through the walls of a rehearsal space. butch was always there and yet we took him for granted. butch was a cool cat from another planet. we though he'd last like a piece of granite. on your grandmother's kitchen cabinet. we thought he'd always be there like the stars and the moon. but we're all gonna end up ashes in an urn or bones under a tomb. he'd watch over us down there in the tl. he'd watch us rock out to our music and was always supportive as hell. he worked for fishbone and george clinton when he was younger. to be around music butch had an insatiable hunger. (butch) butch could show you respect and uplift your spirit. (butch) butch could lay down the law and make you fear him. (butch) butch could make you laugh and smile if you earned it. (butch) butch had that sunny liston stare down if you deserved it. . i remember thanksgiving out at my house just a few years ago with caroline and butch and nathan. we watched drugstore cowboy and butch gave caroline tips on how to cook a turkey. she thought butch was charming and sweet and he really took to her too. matt dillon's character in drugstore cowboy was after dilaudid, the holy grail of pharmaceuticals. butch knew what dilaudid was. he was older than me so there were things you didn't have to explain to butch. there were things he just got and understood. when someone is older than you always take the time to listen to them. a person older than you knows something that you don't. at the very least butch knew what it meant to be black and born in 1952. do you? because i don't know shit about that. i remember the wood burning stove and the heat was really cranking in the living room. nathan kept getting up to remove himself from the heat and to have a smoke outside. but butch didn't budge unless he needed to go to the bathroom. butch wasn't the agile mother fucker he used to be and he needed a damn good reason to get up off of that cozy chair. butch's favorite part of the turkey was the drumstick and when they left, at around midnight or so, butch took almost all the leftovers with him. that was butch. if he was in your backstage area forget it. he had a relentless hunger and thirst and he cleaned your backstage area out. . butch makes sure no one stole no microphones. butch makes sure that safely, you return home. butch makes sure no one stole your keys to your car or your wallet. butch makes you clean your own fucking piss off the toilet. there's no fucking around with butch. he'd shake you down. he'd put you in check until you felt like a fucking clown. every day he'd watch the pigeons flutter. he saw the bums sleeping in the gutter. and san francisco's tenderloin. he walked the streets but i couldn't say if he felt joy. and when my time comes for me to die. i hope i see butch again and to pass some time. i'm sorry man i didn't get a chance to say goodbye. but i hope you like my little butch lullaby. i'm sorry man that i didn't get a chance to say goodbye. but i hope you like my little butch lullaby. this one's for you. this one's for you. this one's for you (butch). this little lullaby (x10). (butch) butch was the resident mayor of the tenderloin. (butch) butch was into red hot chili peppers funky monks video. (butch) butch threatened a guy with a machete who was messing with equipto. (butch) butch was there when i cut old ramon in the studio. . may 28th, 12:58 am, 2016. i'm just back from butch's memorial. i stopped and got a bouquet of poppies along the way. it was a sparse attendance when i first showed up but it filled up pretty quickly. i stayed out back for a while in the alley with a handful of people sharing stories about butch almost directly under the room where he died. stories ranged from butch chasing people with sickles, to his times with george clinton, to his always entertaining mood swings people encountered over the years. i asked a friend when it was exactly that butch began working at hyde street and he said that butch turned up with george clinton's entourage about 20 years ago or so. that he just never left. he said that there were several times he wanted to strangle butch but that he had an unexplainable affection for him that kept him around. everyone had a lot of love for butch, but seemed to have experienced some kind of confrontation with him except for me. all of my experiences with him over the years were pleasant and i asked someone why that was. somebody said, ""because you're mark kozelek"". and i said, ""no seriously really"". and they said, ""well, that's because you never told him what to do"". that was correct. in all the years i've known butch i have no memory of ever telling him what to do. i mean i've seen him get serious and angry before but it was always out of protectiveness and he was never hostile towards me. at some point a couple asked me if i wanted to go smoke a joint with them, with a group of people, up in the echo chamber. i said well i don't smoke pot but sure, i'd be happy to join them and that i hadn't been in the echo chamber for years. the last time i was in the echo chamber it had been a storage room filled with amps and 10 inch tapes. we went up there and a girl liked the way her singing voice sounded with all that echo. she sounded like janis joplin and we all hummed along and tapped our feet as a joint that looked like a small wet cigar got passed around. when we left the room several of the people began climbing the long ladder that leads to the roof. they asked me to join but i said, ""no fucking way, i'm too old"". it was late and i was ready to go home. as i left a band was playing in the main room and lots of pizza boxes were everywhere and beers all around and girls were dancing. butch would've loved it. i hugged a few familiar faces goodbye and headed out onto hyde street into the heart of the tenderloin like i've done so many times over the years. this time butch didn't follow me out like he would often do asking me to buy him a 40",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-butch-lullaby-lyrics,0.138,0.782,0.079,0.921,0.5295

Sun Kil Moon,Coyote,I Also Want to Die in New Orleans,2019,"you pointed out the fence. it was leaning towards the neighbor's house. the waterlogged firewood from the last few winters. had become one with the fence. the mold holding it all together, the weight of the wood. the wind blowing in its direction. the rain pouring down the hill was too much for the fence. a few years earlier, i had an old tree chopped down. that was leaning towards the house. to protect the roof and for firewood. and now i've got twenty yards of fence to rebuild. i started bringing the heavy, wet logs into the back area. into what i referred to as the dungeon area, two or so at a time. the doctor said i need more exercise. i said, ""what kind of exercise?"". she said, ""it doesn't matter, any kind"". i figure i'd have to get some of it out of the way. to help whoever i'd hire to repair the fence. i was breakin' out with sweat. when a neighbor appeared out of nowhere. and said, ""how's it goin', neighbor?"". why did he have to build a house on that empty lot. with tall oaks and pines and sequoias there?. year after year, the grass would grow so tall and get so dry. that the property was a borderline fire hazard. i called a real estate agent and offered to buy that plot of land. but the owner never accepted my offer. i want to maintain my privacy, the house was so enchanting. set back in all the trees. i'd bought the house for the curb appeal and seclusion. the signs on the street that said, ""deer crossing"". then i went out there one day. and the trees in the lot were chopped down. then i went out there another day and the foundation was built. and now there's a house next door. and a neighbor guy i never met. until just now when he said, ""hey, how are you doing?"". i said, ""i'm okay, thanks"". and then turned my back on him and walked into the dungeon. i dropped the logs i was holding on the cement floor. and closed the door behind me. i came back into the house through the dungeon. from another door into the kitchen. and said, ""this is not how i wanted to spend my fucking day"". drenched with sweat, i got an iced tea from the fridge. and walked up to the highest point of my yard. and sat in the sun next to my hot tub. to remind myself why i bought the home in the first place. i looked off at the pines off in the foothills and called my friend. she told me about a strange chinese restaurant. in north canton, ohio. a five-year-old girl was discovered in a freezer. murdered by her mother. her mom got 22 years. the father of the child got a life sentence for influencing. and manipulating the mother. into being the abusive mother she'd become. my friend also said a dead body was discovered. on 8th street in massillon, not far from my father's home. she said the police got a tip. found the body buried six feet deep (buried six feet deep). and they also discovered three neglected kids in that house. all of them under three years old (under three years old). unaccompanied by adults and a neglected dog. in the basement (in the basement). i came back in the house and did what i came here to do. dove into my 2017 expenses. you were watchin' news upstairs. (you were watchin' the news upstairs). a coyote was walking around. with a jar on his head, suffocating (with a jar on his head). someone had some footage of him. roamin' around (roamin' around). the newscaster said (the newscaster said). ""keep a lookout for him"". but they estimated he had 48 hours to live (48 hours to live). i can't take too much of the news anymore. the political things are toxic enough. then there's news of dead children, coyotes suffocating. and neglected dogs without food or water in basements. so we switched channels. there was a band on tv, i'd never seen them before. to my recollection, there were 12 people on stage. pushing buttons in stationary positions. the singer sounded like an even simpler simple minds. if that's possible. but i could pretty much watch anybody perform, to be honest. one of my favorite performers is jimmy swaggart. i could watch him sing gospels all day. but anyhow, after psalm 4, the silver staff band. he said, ""please change this, i can't take it anymore. this sounds like tears for fears"". i thought about textin' a friend. about how depressed i was by this band. by i didn't feel like the back-and-forth. that could potentially happen. at 51, you got to call your shots. on how your prioritize your time and your back-and-forths. then i spent the day working, doing more things for my house. the never=ending fix-up that my mom said i'll be working on. until the day that i die. the money pit, is the chimney guy calling?. the first guy to ever enter my home to do repair on my house. is always somethin', always. at 10 p.m., you said you smelled a skunk (""i smell a skunk""). and you were right, the odor got more intense. i took a piss outside to see if i could smell the skunk and i didn't. while i was takin' a piss, i looked up at the moon. and my god it was beautiful (i looked up at the moon). and it smelled like pine (smelled like pine). all my headaches went away. for just that moment in time (moment in time). i came back and i told you. i couldn't smell the skunk outside (""i can't smell the skunk outside""). but how powerful the smell was. when i came back in through the dining room. i walked up into the master bedroom. and the smell was even worse up there. you'd been on the internet, researching. and decided it was not a skunk. but a gas leak into the house that was going to explode. you said, ""put your jacket on fast and take a few things. and don't do anything to cause any sparks"". i said, ""i have nothing on me. that would cause anything to make sparks"". you said it again, you said, ""don't do anything to make sparks"". i said, ""i don't smoke cigarettes, i don't have matches. or anything at all to cause anything to make any fucking sparks"". you said, ""well, if you do anything to make any kind of friction. it could cause sparks"". and at that point, i kept my mouth shut. i followed you along down the stairs. i said, ""whatever you need from me, whatever you need. just let me know what you need"". we took the battery powered lantern from the porch. and i walked around the house and proved to you. there are no gas lines comin' into my home. i know this home like the back of my hand. you finally calmed down. and i was upset that we had missed saturday night live. we came back in, and you told me. to look around that big, old, spooky house for the skunk. it was 1:30 in the mornin'. i said, ""what the fuck am i gonna do if i find a skunk?. i'm not a skunk catcher. you want me to go down into the basement. and see if there's a skunk down there, that's where you think he is?. sorry, but i wouldn't even know what to do if i cornered a skunk"". i said to you, ""look, here's the deal, we're leavin' tomorrow. and who knows how long it's gonna be until we're back here?. the skunk was a welcome guest in my home. this is my home and i got taxes to work on. i don't want to talk about the skunk anymore"". you said, ""calm down, mark"". that you'd been researching more and that skunks were foragers. and i said, ""what does 'forager' mean?"". you said, ""that means they don't stay in one spot long"". and i said, ""well, there you go. he'll be gone within the next few days. problem solved, the skunk problem is resolved"". we were exhausted. we considered leaving but it was late out there. we went to bed with the smell of skunk in the air. i was up until three o'clock in the mornin'. reading a confederacy of dunces. tired of all the bickering we'd been through. we tend to have this bickering way about us. on these fast ""quick, let's go check on the house"" visits. i woke up at six o'clock in the morning. my heart was racing, i couldn't fall back asleep. so i woke you up, we walked into town. i got a bagel, you got an iced coffee and i got an iced tea. we came back and i did the usual routines. locked up the house, shut off the water. left money for the maid, turned on the alarm system. and set the thermostat. and i took photos of the early-blooming daffodils. and sent them to my friend. i sat at the top of the hill again, takin' in the sun again. trying to remember. why i ever bought this house in the first place again. a hummingbird was buzzing around me by the bamboo. smoke was coming out of the chimneys. i don't understand myself. i spend the first 18 years of my life. trying to get out of a three-bedroom house. with a yard full of sticks and squirrels. then, way later in life, i ended up buying a three-bedroom house. with a yard full of sticks and squirrels. you were in the kitchen, dehydratin' vegetables. with the dehydrator your father gave you. i walked back down the hill, my back hurting. into the living room door. you said, ""i'm done dehydrating vegetables. i'm packed and ready to go"". there was still the faint smell of skunk lingering in the house. it was super bowl sunday. and the traffic goin' back to san francisco was hell. you dropped me off at my place. and i've known you long enough to know. that look on your face. that says, ""i don't want to see you for a couple of days"". so i left you alone, cleaned my apartment, made my bed. opened some windows, cleaned my hardwood floors. and i dumped the bag of 2017 paperwork on the living room floor. you sent me a text, ""yay, they rescued the coyote. and got the jar off his head, he survived""",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-coyote-lyrics,0.062,0.868,0.07,0.93,0.496
Sun Kil Moon,Day in America,I Also Want to Die in New Orleans,2018,"deadliest school shooting since sandy hook. on valentine's day yesterday in florida, it tore legs. it's 5:30 am, the news has been on since i've been home. since one o'clock in the morning. i've been wakin' up every hour or so, lookin' at the cnn tv glow. came home, opened my email. my friend kevin asked, ""how are you processing this?"". i said i was in the studio gettin' ready to sing. then the drummer walked in and said, ""hey, did you see this?"". i said, ""what?"". he said, ""looks like another high school shooting"". i said, ""where?"". he said, ""looks like it happened about an hour north of miami"". i said, ""how many?"". he said, ""it looks like fourteen, or something"". i told kevin, from that point on. my band discussed it for maybe 20 minutes. donny said, ""why don't they just get rid of the guns. like they did in australia?"". i sat there befuddled and said, ""i don't know what to tell ya. but the republicans like having their right to bear arms. even if it blows kids off the planet. they spend rest of their lives without their legs and arms. the republicans believe in their right to bear arms. no matter the rising death toll. and the amount of harm it causes to innocent people. they have their right to bear arms"". and, honestly, from that point on, we picked up our instruments. i got three musicians out here from new york. and we're here to play music, and they were on the clock. so until i got home tonight and saw your email. all the thoughts about the florida shooting, i blocked. another player had joined us last night around 6 or 7. we were improvising on a piece of music. that he said sorta reminded him of bill evans. it sounded good to me, it sounded like a slice of heaven. jim was playin' his drums but donny wouldn't play. and after about 15 minutes of this beautiful piano playing. donny stood up and said. ""you guys, this doesn't sound like bill evans"". i said, ""what do you mean?"". he said, ""this is bill evans"". i asked the drummer, ""did you notice?"". he said, ""yes"". and i said, ""well, what in the fuck are we doin'?"". i said to the player who had joined us. here for fifteen solid minutes. i was like, ""damn, this piece of music is genius"". and he said, ""well, like i said. it's this left-handed thing in the style of bill evans"". i said, ""but donny and jim said it actually is bill evans. and thank god they were here to tell me this, thank evans. or i would have released this beautiful song. and someone would have called me out. and said, ""you ripped off bill evans"". i asked the guys, ""who is this guy, anyhow?"". ""it's bill evans,"" he said. ""one of the most famous jazz pianists in the world"". i said, ""i think i may have heard of him. or maybe i'm getting him confused. with the chain food restaurant bob evans. bob evans, yeah, i got that association, bob evans"". i was with my friend's sister debbie. when i was 18 in ohio at a local thrash metal show. we walked outside to have a cigarette. it was freezing outside, the ground was covered in snow. when a girl confronted debbie outside and said. ""you think you're so fuckin' cool. with your nose in the air, don't you?"". debbie said, ""what are you even talkin' about?. i've never even met you"". the girl said, ""you're a fuckin' snob. i've been standing around and observin' you all night. with your dyed black hair. you think you're too cool for school, don't you?"". debbie got tense, raised her voice. and said, ""so i've traveled a bit. what do you know about anything? what do you know?"". debbie's tone was getting aggressive and escalating. she said to the girl ""where in the fuck have you ever been to. in this world besides ohio?"". the girl just stood there and got this big smirk on her face. and i thought, ""oh no"". and she sucker punched debbie. knocked her ass down to the ground. and spit in her face and walked back to the thrash metal show. i lifted debbie from the snow. and she stood there sobbing and sobbing. her brother came up to me and said, ""mark, what's goin' on?. what happened to debbie?"". i said, ""man, it all happened so fast. i'm sorry i didn't do anything to protect your sister"". he pulled me aside, he said, ""let me tell you something, mark. don't worry about it, she's always had a mouth on her"". i said, ""i know, but she's your sister, i've got her back. you enjoy the concert, i've got it from here"". and i said, ""don't worry about this, debbie will shake it off. now let's get the fuck out of here"". we got in her car. and i told her i understood this humiliating feeling. oh, i got knocked out a few times myself. and i know it's humbling and embarrassing. so we went to bob evans and sat and drank coffee. and i tried to talk debbie into a calmer state. she was so distracted and i tried to console her. but she was clearly hijacked. in too much emotional pain for conversation. said, ""debbie, drop me off"". and from that point on, i don't think i ever heard from her again. i think it's because she associates me with that bad night. that ended at bob evans, and i understand. and on the way home, i said to my friend. ""why'd you kick off tonight with the bill evans song?"". he said, ""i was just tryin' to ease into things"". i said, ""that's cool, but we're not a cover band. we're here to make an album of original songs"". he said, ""yeah, i guess that was wrong"". i said, ""yeah man, everything is sort of anticlimactic. when you try to come up with fresh ideas after playing bill evans"". he said, ""yeah you're right, i don't know what i was thinking"". i said, ""hey don't worry about it. everything else you played sounded amazing"". so anyhow, i came home and i turned on the news. angry as i always get when these things happen. tryin' to think of what i could do. to help the cause, to influence people. to do what i can to change gun laws. for starters, i'm gonna dedicate a song. to the kids from florida who didn't live long, whose families grieve. while the rest of the world gets on their phones. and their lives go on. and maybe in the song, i'll share my own private thoughts. in fact, i think i will. i think they should go django unchained on the killer they caught. hang him upside down and cut off his balls. bleed him to death and let him bleed a slow, bloody death. when 17 kids are murdered, you skip due process. i don't care if he was vulnerable. in a home full of drug abuse and incest. or allegedly brainwashed by white supremacists. whatever the case may be for him. yeah, it's very sad and unfortunate. but escorting this man from the planet. is in everyone's best interest. when a guy can kill 17 kids, dispose of him quick and fast. i live in san francisco. and my thoughts on this might go against the flow. but yeah, i think they should torture him to death. with whatever the methods may have been used at guantanamo. make an example of him and hang him up to dry. i say more aggressive action. should be taken against mass shooters, at least give it a try. anyone who maps out the death of innocent kids. should not have the privilege of bein' alive. maybe the parents of the kids will get together. and kill him vigilante-style. maybe somebody down in the local jail. will meet up with him in the infirmary and stab him 17 times. and justice will prevail, and that'll be the end of the story. of the valentine's day killer's miserable life. so i asked kevin by email, ""by the way. how are you processing this?. it's gotta be harder for you than it is for me. you got a 13-year-old kid"". but kevin's on new york time. and it's 6:30 am, and so far from kevin no reply. another day in america, another day in the life. another day in america, another day in the life. another day in america, another day in the life. another day in america, another day in the life. republicans will say, ""this is been a sad day in america. we're sorry for the families of the dead children"". then they'll go on about second amendment rights. and stand there with their white dicks and their white hands. and stand next to their white wives. another day in america, another bag of white rice. i just woke up this morning, february 15th. i had a dream about ar-15s, probably based on the news. that said eight million americans own ar-15s. and i dreamed i was doin' vocals. i asked my engineer what kind of mic we're usin' today. and he said, ""an ar-15"". i said, ""isn't that the name of the gun. that did the killing at the school yesterday?"". and he said, ""no, that was an m-49"". i said, ""i thought we normally use the u-47"". he said, ""sometimes, other times we use an audio technica 4060. or the shure sm-7"". i said, ""well, they all sound like automatic weapons to me. that send innocent kids off to heaven. so i prefer if we don't use the ar-15"". and he said, ""but it's the best microphone this studio has available"". i said, ""but that microphone. is what politicians use at press conferences"". then i woke up from the dream. so that's it, i got out of bed and took a bath. and got ready to go to the studio. and i got kevin's reply by email. i called him up and asked if he would kindly read it to me. i don't think i am processing it. unless reading about it on the internet counts. reading it and internalizing what's. being written about it and tweeted about it. which is that nothing ever changes. and that another shooting will happen every 16 hours. that columbine was 20 years ago now. it was in the news at that time for months and years. but parkland will likely disappear from the news cycle in a week. george carlin used the expression ""circling the drain"". circling the drain to describe the human condition. i believe the, our, this ceaseless, endless madness and violence. and the resulting information overload. and the subsequent collective amnesia. has to mean we're so close to the drain at this point. circling it so intensely at this point. that the experience can no longer be processed. because we're moving too fast. and because we're being processed. pulsed, like

Sun Kil Moon,Bay of Kotor,I Also Want to Die in New Orleans,2019,"woke up this morning hungry, i walked along the bay of kotor. there's a market down there, past the sailboats, down the gravel road. i went looking for the kittens that i saw last night, and their protective mother. i found two short-haired cow-print kittens and the little gray one, they were all cuddled up. . the little gray one didn't look up, i blew her kisses. she never turned her head, i petted her with my index finger. felt her spine, she was all bones, not much flesh, she was dying. the other two kittens each had an eye missing. . the mother sat close by and got up once to lick them. they sat quietly in an opening of the stone wall along the water. a rectangular shaped hole in the middle of the wall with rusty iron bars. and as i watched, i heard another kitten cry. . from the other side of the wall, which stood about ten to twelve feet high. there's nothing i hate more than the sound of hungry animals crying. there's nothing i hate more than the sound of hungry animals crying. there's nothing i hate more than the sound of hungry animals crying. there's nothing i hate more than the sound of hungry animals crying. . finding footing in the nook, i climb the stone wall. the dog walkers looked at me as if i was mentally ill. i saw another black-and-white kitten on the other side of the wall. meowing ""please mommy, please feed me, i'm hungry"". . she was looking into my eyes from the field of purple flowers. she was pawing at the wall, trying to get to her mother, and her sister, and her brother. stretched out from back to front paw she was maybe a foot long. and she cried, ""waaah, waaah, waaah, waaah"". . . she had about five feet there, to get up to the nest. of her siblings, to her mother's love, for that kitty in the purple flowers. her mother didn't budge. . i could've hurled myself over, to rescue the little one. but i would've broken my ankle like dustin hoffman in papillon. i walked further down the street to the market on the corner. where the locals and the tourists are gathered at 7 o'clock in the morning, waiting for the store to open. . when it opened, i walked up and i down its lonely lanes. listeneding to the customers and clerks speaking various foreign languages. i bought oranges and water, sardines, and bananas. two mega-sized cans of tuna and carried the groceries past the dog walkers. . . i saw the mother cat with the two kittens, but the gray one was gone. maybe her mother pushed her over, down to the purple flowers, to join the other one. when i petted the gray one earlier her chin was leaning on the edge of the wall, faced down towards the flowers. i thought of mickey rourke in spun, he said, ""my mom was drowning puppies in the bathtub. why keep what you can't feed?"". . . i opened the cans of tuna, with the lid, and tossed them tuna over the wall. aiming for the spot where i've seen the hungry kitten trying to crawl. and i sat the cans down near the kittens nest, two healthier cats smelled the tuna. slouched their way over, one black, one butterscotch vanilla. . . jet-lagged, a big wave hit me. i did all i could've done. i walked to the hotel breakfast room. with a maid who seems to have taken a liking to me. mirjana, saw me eating my eggs like a hungry prisoner and said. ""easy, easy!"". . i came back to my room. a book has been on the bedside stand since i arrived here. i'm not sure what language it's in, but it says. ""svetski bestseler #1, danielle steel"". the four biggest words on the book were spelled like this:. ""k-n-j-i-g-a. s-a-d i z-a-u-v-e-k"". . . i couldn't fall asleep, mirjana came and knocked on my door. ""here are some towels. come, eat, mark! eat, eat, you must eat some more!"". ""give me a few minutes"", i said, ""i'll be right over""; ""oh, you, mark! come down!"". and when i walked towards the breakfast area she ordered me to get the others, she said, ""mark, go get them now"". . i said, ""i can't wake them"", i told her, ""they're sleeping and they need some rest"". ""tell me"", she said, ""why do you look like this? so sad all the time... so sad... why, mark? why do you look like this?"". ""'cause i'm jet-lagged"", i told her, ""and then my clock is off. please knock on my door around 5 p.m. to wake me and you might just see a happier mark"". . ""you might even see a smile!""; and she said, in her serbian accent, ""i will do that! do you know who you remind me of, mark?"". ""who?"", i said; ""john malkovich"". i ate some cereal and scrambled eggs and went back to bed. she knocked on my door an hour early, 4 p.m. . ""mark, wake up! wake up!""; i picked up my pants from the floor. i put on some slippers and my t-shirt and decided to swim in the bay of kotor. the same shirt i've been wearing for the last three days. and i walked down the path of oleanders, wisteria, and agave. . and the palm trees to the bay; my stomach growled with hunger so i kept walking past the boats and the sunbathers. the dog walkers with their dogs on their collars, and the stray dogs, and the skinny cats, to a restaurant called ""ellas"". . . a waitress named sandra came and took my order. ""fish soup with greek salad, please, and a large bottle of sparkling water"". i looked across the aquafresh-crest-toothpaste-colored water. at the town of muo with the little stucco houses with the spanish roofs. . i asked sandra what the orange things were, floating in the water. she said, “they're called 'bova' and they have nets and they harvest black mussels”. on my walk back to the hotel i jumped into the bay of kotor. as i walked along the mossy rocks the moss soothed the bottom of my feet. . i was wading out in the seaweed looking at the girls layin' out in their bikinis. i never wrote a song about girls in bikinis; if i did, maybe i'd have a hit like the beach boys. i saw a bandmate walking down the road. he noticed me out in the water and said, ""hey, mark, soundcheck' s pretty soon, we better go”. . while we were rehearsing, mirjana heard the music echoing around the tile floor. she knocked on the door and asked if she could come listen, and we said, ""yeah, sure!"". she heard two songs, we said, ""what do you think?; she said, “sounds like steely dan, but crazy!”. . . sea rock festival, july 21. from the start my guitar was out of tune. so i sat it on the stand and walked towards the front of the stage. howled to the castles up in the mountains and sang tunefully to the moon. . ramon on guitar, chris on piano, they held their end stoically and steadily. a nice, receptive, family-oriented crowd; i didn't make adjustments for them. . i gave them the good, the bad, the ugly. i sang mother's love, and 666 post, and i encouraged them to cheer. for andrew golota, though i doubt many there heard of him in montenegro. it was a fun night, cathartic and exhilarating. . . the next day at lunch a stray dog kept me company over at ellas. the waiter came by and had the check in his hand in an oblong folder. he was asking me in serbian if i was ready for the check. (i thought that's what he was asking). . and when i nodded, ""yes"", he smacked the dog on the butt. the dog let out a high-pitched ""woof!"" and ran off. i stood up and said, ""why did you do that!?""; he said ""dogs are problem here"". i went and found the dog and petted his head. . lured him back to my table with a piece of french bread, he sat next to my table. i told the waiter, ""don't ever do that again. it's ok. i like the dog near me"". the dog was picky and didn't like the bread. so i put a piece of penne pasta up to his nose instead. . and he bit my hand, finicky stray. ""that's ok"", i told him. ""bite my hand all you want. keep me company awhile. your bites are nothing compared to the sick feeling i suffer. every time i turn on american tv news channels"". . . i paid the check and left with my large bottle of sparking water. and when i got up, mirjana had just been seated at a nearby table with another maid. she said, ""mark, i must tell you. you are like a machine. you sleep, you eat, you shit, you make music. you are a machine"". . i said ""i guess so"" and i went back to my room. at about 9 p.m. chris knocked on my door and woke me. chris and ramon and i took a cab into the old part of town for dinner. but before we left, three maids, including mirjana, who are always sitting down the cement walkway from me. drinking wine, coffee, and smoking cigarettes. observing the coming and goings of passersby, started talking to us. . . ...chris and ramon, with me standing right there, ""i told mark today. he is a machine. he eats, sleeps, shits, and plays music. this man is a machine"". then she introduced us to ljiljana, whom i already met a bunch of times. and the other maid who has never spoken a word to me, milica. . mirjana pointed to milica and said, ""mark, milica has something to tell you. she wants to marry you"", i took a step back. then i smiled and said ""her and i have never spoken a word. but, yeah, if i lived in kotor, sure... why not... i would marry her"". then milica corrected mirjana in serbian. mirjana then said to me, ""oh, i misunderstood. milica said she wants to fuck you”. . ramon and chris and i let out an awkward giggle, then we were speechless. i then politely asked mirjana what her friend's name was again. ""it's milica, you crazy man! you are crazy!"". ramon saved me, “hey you guys, i want to get going, i just wanna get a cab"". that was our segue and chris and i followed along. . but not before i told the maids, ""hey, you all have a nice life here. drinking wine among friends, looking out at the bay. i've seen you all at the restaurant down the street and laying out on the beach. this is a nice life you have, ending your days this way. it's beautiful here - the smell of the salt water and the italian pines"". . . ""fuck you, crazy man! you join us in the kitchen tomorrow!. work with us and see how good this life is, you fuck!"". ""hey"", i told her, ""we all have to go to work. you think this life is glamourous? it took me 30 hours to get here. and i'm gonna spend 30 hours in airports and on airplanes to get home"". . she said, ""i know, i know, you work hard, mark, it's true, i know. you know something? you look like john malkovich"". i said, ""i know, you told me that earlier"". i'll never forget mirjana. i think i'll send her a postcard when i get back to san francisco. . . after having dinner in the old part of town, ramon stayed to see some jazz. and chris and i came back with a plan to meet in five minutes down by the gate and go for a walk along the bay. i walked down to my room and milica appeared with a large empty water bottle. ""water?"", she asked; i think it was freudian, to see if i wanted to fill the bottle. i said that i'd be ok, but for her to please wait, and that i'd bring her a cd. (mirjana said that milica wanted a copy of my music). i gave her mark kozelek night talks and she shyly walked off towards their little smoking area. and that's the last i've seen of her before the night. i know the loneliness of the road but in that moment i knew the loneliness of the live-in maid. . chris and i then walked along the bay and to my usual spot, ellas. the same place where the waitress explained the orange things that harvested mussels. and where the guy whacked the dog on the butt. we had sparkling water and ice cream. howe gelb stopped by and said hi. i'm back in my room now. i've not turned on this tv since i've been here... bliss. it's 3:29 a.m. goodnight from my hotel room. kotor, montenegro, 7/23/2018. . . today i awoke at 6:55 a.m, in time for breakfast. mirjana said to me, ""this thing you say last night... about how we have a good life... why... why did you say that to us?"". i think she thought i was being patronizing but i wasn't. i said, ""i told you that because i grew up in the middle of a bunch of cornfields, nowhere near the adriatic sea or the bay of kotor"". . ""you seem to have a nice bond with your co-workers and it seems like a nice place to relax. and at the end of the day to look up at the stars. but this is my weekend trip and this is your everyday, so i understand if you're upset by what i said”. she said, “my friends only think of themselves. never mind all of this beauty you see. it's inside of here!"", pointing to her chest. inside of here, mark, is shit. they tell me, 'do this! do that!' this life is shit!"". . i got up and hugged her and told her that i meant no harm, that i meant well. that i understood she works very hard, and we hugged for a long time, no nervous pats on the back. she said ""what will you do now, after breakfast?""; i said ""the same thing i always do - go back to my room and get some sleep"". she told me, ""please, come back before 10 o'clock in the morning and eat some more"", and i said i'd try. . she wrote her name on a piece of paper; i told her i'd send her a postcard if i didn't get a chance to say goodbye. i went back to bed and woke up at 12:25 p.m. i'm gonna walk along the road to ellas, past the stray cats, and dogs, and oleanders, and agave, and palm trees, and sailboats, and sunbathers again. taking a towel and plan to wade around in the bay of kotor one last time. . 3 a.m. call for our flight back to san francisco from some place in croatia tonight. i'm back in my room; it was overcast and i skipped swimming. i just shadow boxed four three-minute rounds with a bottle of water in each of my hands. 3:12 p.m, kotor, montenegro, 7/23/2018. . i wrote those words then back in july, but just sang them today, august 15th, 2018. it's day 6 of the six-day recording session, we're wrapping up this record that i recorded with donny and jim. last night i told nathan, ""man, my ears are burned out, i'm so fucking tired. let's go to colombo tomorrow, the town they discovered gold. back on january 24th, my birthday, but, you know, 1848""; nathan said, ""sure, ok. we'll go"". . so we drove out there this morning and got in the water and i swam from one side of the american river to the other, and back. i picked some blackberries and put them in my bottle of water, and planted a cactus that was getting too big for my appartment. it was nice to see all of the apple orchards and cows along the way; we talked about what guys have been to vacaville, what guys have been to folsom prison. i need to go out there and do all that to be able to do what i just did. goodnight. 9:55 p.m, august 15th, 2018. san francisco",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-bay-of-kotor-lyrics,0.089,0.861,0.05,0.95,0.5195

""if you see somebody hungry, and sleeping in the gutter, hold them in your arms and tell them that you love them, for they're all your sisters and your brothers."" i said that. so i went to breakfast room the next day very well rested. i said ""how do i look today?"" and she studied my eyes so closely, if she were a doctor and i were being tested. she said ""looks like you slept too much, and this is also not healthy."". i said ""where you from?"". she said ""romania"". i said ""what part?"". she said ""transylvania."". i asked ""hey, what brings you here to ghent?"". she said ""my husband is italian, my son is three. what is this? why? are you interviewing me?"". i said ""i was just wondering how someone ends up in ghent from transylvania."". she said ""well you're here. and where are you from exactly?"". i said ""the state where the kids at kent station were killed west of pennsylvania."". she said ""do you mind if i say: you show signs of megalovania"". i said ""i don't mind. can i sit down now? it's 6:59."". she said ""ok. what can i get you?"". i said ""nothing. i still got my bottle of water from the plane. i flew over on lufthansa."". she said ""yeah, drink lots of water"" and we talked about the heat. we talked about the august heat and the european heat wave. i said ""every time i play belgium in the summer, it's usually pissing rain."". she said ""yeah, this is the worst heat wave we've had since 1978."". i said ""yeah, and my hotel has no ac."". and she said ""poor thing."". we played our concert in ghent on a bar on a beautiful blue telecaster. and i asked the guy who owned it ""can i ask you a question"", he said ""sure, mark, ask me anything, i'll give you an answer"". i said ""this is the nicest telecaster i've ever played. is there any chance i can buy it from you?"". he said ""well, this is your answer, i can't sell it to you. this was my father's and he passed it on to me before he passed of bone cancer."". i left the hotel at one o'clock in the morning, all the street fare stands were closing. but there was a group of flemish people standing around a guy who barbequeing something that looked and smelled so good, i don't have to open my mouth. for europeans, a known american, my belly gives it away and so do my baggy clothes. it doesn't matter the size and shape of people in europe, they all wear very tight clothes. anyhow, i asked a group of people hanging around the barbeque ""how do i order?"" the barbeque guy laughed at me and pointed at the three ladies in aprons standing on the street corner. they said ""how many do you want? he is closing."". i said six, and everybody laughed. one lady said ""you can only have four"" holding four fingers up to my face. so i went and stood with the people and the cook, who looked at me twice, and said two words in flemish that had everybody busting up laughing. my guess is that he said ""stupid american"". my guess is that he said ""stupid american"". even if they were laughing at my expense, i didn't care and i laughed along with them. usa's a laugh, ok, i was too tired to defend where i live. this country is a laugh, and i'm sorry, but again, i was too tired to defend where i live. i mean, what did we invent? i was thinking the iphone, myspace, okcupic? no wonder everyone in the rest of the world thinks we're all so fucking stupid. i mean, buffalo invented buffalo wings, and to me that's a very cool thing. but at a certain point buffalo wings are heart attack makers so buffalo had to invent another thing called the pacemaker. what a wonderful contribution to our world. kids are committing suicide because they're being cyberbullied thanks to inventions created by nerds. trump is rallying troops via an invention created by nerds. oh, let me guess, when you listen to music, these are not the kind of words you want to listen to. you'd rather listen to eight miles high by the birds, but you don't want to listen to music at all, you want to binge out on some tv series or another. there's so many networks now, it's all a blur. amazon, netflix, itunes, hbo, showtime, hulu. i ain't pointing fingers, i watch finding joseph too. and mark duplass is my friend, so i watch creep 1 and i watch creep 2. i need to know i'm loved, fucking off in the morning, at my favorite meal. ""i need eyes looking at me as if there is no other loves on earth."" james kavanaugh said that. ""i love america more than any other country in this world and exactly for this reason. i insist on the right to criticize her perpetually."" james baldwin said that. ""i'm wanna say one thing to the american people. i want you to listen to me. i'm gonna say this again. i did not have sexual relations with that women, miss lewinsky."" bill clinton said that. ""when donald trump becomes president, we will all face reality tv, and twitter, and google, and video games, and everything that has turned this country into a bunch of dumbed down slaves to technology."" i said that. it was fucking hot out. i knew they were laughing at my coat. i always put one on at night. if you lived in san francisco for thirty years, that'd be your natural instinct, too. so i asked the people around me ""what's he barbequeing?"" somebody said ""lamb"". when he divided it all up at the end, he was giving the flemish people theirs first. and after they had all walked away, i was given the last four pieces. i thought ""well, this is a pretty transparent 'fuck you'."" one of the ladies in the apron said as i was walking off ""the last pieces are the best ones. those are good luck."". it was the best lamb i ever tasted, it must have been the salt. at the time, i thought ""holy fuck, this flemish guy is putting a lot of salt on this lamb."" but it must have been the kind of salt that he put on the lamb that gave it the very nice flavor it had. i'm back in san francisco and my bed feels so cozy and fog horns are going off all night. they sound beautiful and i'm reading crocodile by dostoevsky. guy named ivan crawled inside a crocodile's belly and he prefers life inside the gator's belly, so does his best friend. he's got a thing for ivan's lady. now it's daytime, drunk people are walking around my neighborhood and it's twelve noon. i said ""nathan, something seems strange. where are all these people coming from?"". he said ""they're here for the outside lands music festival."". i said ""who's playing?"". he said ""janet jackson, the weeknd, and chromeo."". i said ""well, we gotta get to work so we'll be skipping that.""",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-im-not-laughing-at-you-lyrics,0.15,0.786,0.064,0.936,0.543
Sun Kil Moon,Cows,I Also Want to Die in New Orleans,2019,"i drive the winter roads to navarre after they've been plowed. i look off in the snow and saw the frost-bitten cows. i stare into the big, dumb, brown eyes and in those moments, i felt tranquilized. in those moments, i felt half anesthisized. in those moments in the back seat of my mom's car, i felt hypnotized. in those moments, the am radio played riders on the storm and i fall into the state of euphoria. zarathustra was walking and felt something warm and living. something warm and living nearby that refreshed, and stumbled upon the hill like full of cows. and in nirvana, there was order and warmness that touched his heart. and there among them was the mountain sermonizer. ""what do you see, kid?"", i asked zarathustra. ""same things as you see"", the mountain man said. ""happiness on earth, you peace-breaker."". ""why have you come here? why have you disturbed them? do you not know that if we not become as cows, we shall not enter into the gates of heaven? for there is one thing we should learn from them. and that is rumination."". in the end, zarathustra talked him back to his cave of haunting. zarathustra gave the mountain man shit for loving cows more than money. the mountain sermonizer said ""well, guess what? i have news for you, zarathustra, i have decided that, more than cows, i love you"". zarathustra said ""enough of your flattery"" and poked the  with a stick and he ran off nimbly. see, i grew up in ohio in a rust belt town. and growing up, i gazed off at thousands of cows in my prepubescent years, throughout my teens. i saw lots of dairy cows, guernseys, and holsteens. from my perspective, the space between their ears was hollow. they did not know yesterday from two seconds ago from tomorrow. from my perspective, they did not feel happiness, they did not feel sorrow. cows are harmless creatures, they are innocent. every small thing they do is tender and sweet and benevolent. i looked back at those drives past with sweet sentiment. it was good to get away from the downtown mass in ohio cement. though those drives are sometimes boring and seem very far, i have fond memories of my mom dropping us off at a relative's in navarre. cow, cow, cow, cow, cow, cow, cow, cow. nietzsche's passage got me thinking about cows and this kick drum going ""pow. pow. pow. pow. pow. pow."". trigger the word ""cow"" and everything is unraveled from the word ""cow"". and this kick drum sound ""pow. pow. pow. pow. pow."". from this day forward, i solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow. from this day forward, i solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow. from this day forward, i solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow. from this day forward, i solemnly vow to only once a month sink my teeth into the flesh of a cow. for i love steaks at harris' restaurant on havana street, and bulgogi in seoul, korea or in new york on 32nd street, and brisket at jack's barbeque on broadway in nashville, tennessee, and beef jerky at 7/11 when i'm on the road and i'm low on protein. to give up cow flesh entirely and completely at this stage of my life i'm afraid would be very hard for me. for half a century, i have enjoyed the tasty flavor of cow meat. aw, it tastes so good, my mind's chop suey. see, as a kid in ohio, driving out of town, they'd comfort me, gazing off at the cows. then later i moved out to california and the most beautiful animals i still see are cows. driving through petaluma over to bolinas point, there are many cows grazing. on the way to the beach, when i see them, my body gets lazy, my mind gets all buzzy and hazy. not far from my home is, in new orleans now, is a closed down dirty plant where they used to be a statue of a cow. why did i pick a home to a place so close to where they process the milk of cows? every night i went to sleep and woke up to the milk truck sounds. and when i could barely walk, my dad worked at overland dairy, seven days a week, i asked him just today how much they paid him weekly. he said ""i don't remember, mark, that was so long ago. but they gave me two free gallons of milk daily."". i said, ""but i remember mom pulling milk bottles out of a silver box a couple times a week."". he said, ""well, mark, that's after i quit my job as a milkman."". i said ""oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense why it was mom who picked those heavy milk bottles up from the doorstep. cause you had a new job and you were traveling around."". he said ""yeah, i was traveling regionally and was selling cold medicine from town to town."". i don't eat much chicken. better find a better finger licking, but i do love fish and i love creole dishes. gulf coast stores, just-fried gator and crawfish. i wouldn't be surprised if i died of a heart attack in felix's in new orleans. in fact if i fall over there and died, do not get all sappy. if i died in felix's eating oysters and crawfish, know that i died happy. ""god is dead"". with nietzsche, on that, i agree. but where he stands on cows, i can not totally proceed. when i look out at the animals, they radiate serenity. cows are as close to perfect beings as it gets to me. i look out into the bay and see the prow of an incoming scow. the picture calms my nerves when i stare out the window. like a cow, my brain goes blank and i find peace in the here and now. i'm as calm as a pasture-grazing cow. their moos, to my ears, are sweeter than a cat's meow. flash elorde fought many times at san francisco's cow palace. and in the garden, he fought frankie narvaez. my favorite part of the movie *borat* is the part where he tries to kidnap pamela anderson, she runs away from the crowd and she's running through the parking lot screaming, he yells ""i will give you your own plow."" ok, that's all i've got, i've run out of thoughts about cows, at least for now",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-cows-lyrics,0.106,0.848,0.046,0.954,0.53
Sun Kil Moon,Couch Potato,I Also Want to Die in New Orleans,2019,"techies walkin' around, takin' shots at the junkies. i miss san francisco, circa 1990's. it was peaceful then and the world was much less whiny, i read books, conversed at the cafes, and y'all went out to the movies. pre-twitter shit, no emotion-alterin' the rise of technology. pre-facebook shit, and all my dumb idiocracy, pre-bandwagon shit, no knee-jerk, post, triggerin arguments about (?), and the accusations against morgan freeman. homelessness was sad, but we didn't try to erase them from this city's history. and throwing names at them that are demoralizing, uncool, and derogatory. what's it to you, some use your land(?), under a pretty palm tree down the street? what's it to you, some bus stop's somebody else's lavatory? all you do is stay in and order food from your apps anyway. potatoes, potatoes, whiny goddamn couch potatoes. potatoes, potatoes, whiny goddamn couch potatoes. and you're hijacked by everything that pops up on your phone. and you're angry about it for an hour until the news diverts your attention by throwing you another bone. and yeah, you're justified in being angry the kids are being pulled from their parents at the border, but when obama had illegal immigrants thrown out of the country left and right, y'all thought he was adorable. made you feel so good to love the smiling light-skin black man, but like i said, illegals were being thrown out of the country under him. i wrote a song once for an immigrant, years ago, who broke the law. he had three kids. three kids and he was sent back to mexico where his wife and kids didn't even get a phone call. under obama, guys were getting sent back to their birth places. y'all i sang that song for you, and you requested it at my shows! that song, if you all remember, was called gustavo. don't give much thought to gustavo. i don't give much thought to gustavo. i don't give much thought-. you thought that song was funny. you thought the song was sweet. that it was cute, you didn't think about those kids gettin' pulled from their daddies much, did you? but now your hearts hurt from the kids being pulled from their mommies and daddies, aren't you? what's been happening for years is just now the news, just finally spin it in a way that alarms you. this whole agenda promotin' the orangutan who came from the zoo who's gonna be the president again, mark my words, thanks to the news and social media, and thanks to couch potatoes called you. they ain't even human beings to the people who are on the news. just (?) signs then, you're just all just a bunch of junkies, sniffin' their booze. sniffing whatever the anchor man decides to sell you. sniffers, sniffers, bunch of goddamn booze sniffers. sniffers, sniffers, bunch of goddamn booze sniffers. sniffers, sniffers, bunch of goddamn-. i'm telling you people, if you keep pecking away at your phones, donald duck gonna be in office eight years, cause of prophecy. (350?). donald gonna be there, two full terms, that's for sure. so with the san francisco homeless, and so the (?) pimps and hoes. i don't mind the pimps and hoes, and the bums pissin' in the alleys and nobody else did until san francisco sold its ass to silicon valley. now the rich want to be catered to, they want perfection, they don't want poverty in their streets. but the poor gonna stick around, and in time, all the techies gonna retreat. they never gave a fuck about the golden gate bridge or the beautiful terrain or by cafe trieste where they hate ashberry, or the jefferson airplane. they'll be packing up and leavin' on the google train. maybe move to jellystone park, if we're lucky, and they can cry to yogi bear about all the pain. don't get me wrong, do not think that i don't care. i've employed more illegal immigrants than the average joe on his lunch break in union square. i've given lots of pesos to kids in the streets of guajaca, mexico. i bought their chapolinis every morning from their wooden bowls. me myself, i got an idea of how this president came to office. people believin' the predictions of don lemon as if he were nostradamus. people started givin' platforms to paula deen and paris hilton. people started to believe in headlines that are as believableas bigfoot sightings, and rumpelstiltskin. this morning, i had a dream that i was with caroline at a cafe. somewhere in california, it felt like somewhere in belinas, lots of daylight comin' through the windows. there was a band playing at the corner. we met the drummer, he kinda looked like jack kilmer. he told us that his brother plays a percussive instrument with strings, like guitar strings, they played most did not sustain, but went pling pling. he told us he was gonna drive some place neary to pick up some drumsticks and he asked if we wanted to come along. caroline said ""i'll stick around at the cafe"", but i said i was up for the ride if it wouldn't take too long. and we were drivin', i asked ""where's your brother live?"" and he said long park. and i said ""actually, i've been there. does your brother play in the house band with the long park wine factory?"" he said ""yes"", and i said ""well, i think i've seen him play, a long-haired guy?"". he said ""that's him"" and kept on driving and driving, further and further, and i asked him where he was going. he said ""to san francisco. you said you needed a ride, right?"" i said ""no, man, i thought we were going to your rehearsal space to get some drum sticks, right?"" he said ""no, i'm heading to san francisco, i thought you said that's where you live"". i said ""i do, but hold on, stop the car, tell me we are, you jack kilmer-faced kid"". he pulled over and i called caroline and told her where i was. he dropped me off on the side of the side of the road somewhere in northern california, i waited for caroline to pick me up. and i woke up from the dream, and i walked down to aquatic park. and from the pier, i looked out into the fog. soakin' up the air, i could barely see tiberun. fisherman were fishing on the east side of the pier. every day it's my pleasure to walk out here. three seals poke their heads up from the water. these beautiful things are why i moved here. a man was giving sailboat lessons to a younger man. from there, i walked to levi's store and bought a warmer jacket. nathan overslept and i went, and knocked on his hotel door. past the city lights bookstore and the north beach hotel. i waited for him down in the lobby. watched a young girl ask the lady at the front desk if she knew how to get to yosemite. and nathan and i went and ate sandwiches at malinari's. we went to city lights and i talked to one of the employees. i bought the book about the boxer from modesto, fat city. i bought the book called antisocial media about how facebook undermines democracy. told the staff i was gonna post a photo of the book on my social medxia pages and one of them said ""that's funny."" then nathan and i went to trieste, i got an iced tea, he got a coffee. i said to the guy ""i see you're starting the day with the music of air supply."" and we walked back up the point to the mural of paul kenton. passed city lights again and in the storefront was a huge selection of bukowsky. and we walked up through china town through jack kerouac alley. bought some cucumbers and some blueberries. everything was harmonious and merry. we walked past le hung lao and i thought of the chap(?) dumplings that are always delicious and savory. everything reminded me of what it was about the city that first spoke to me. and as we approached high street studio. we tend to want the homeless as they've always been, minding their own. i sang about everything leading up to waking up and walking to aquatic park. all that must have been sparked by articles my friend had sent me. sensational headlines and attention-grabbing posts like ""medical convention was relocated from san francisco to  la cause doctors are scared"". ""last year at same convention, somebody's purse was stolen"". ""i'm from a third-world country, and san francisco is worse"". ""norway valley, shocked and disgusted by the homeless"". ""middle-age tech guys angry cause they saw feces on the street corner once"". i don't know what it is that they see or feel. i told him, man, there are places for people who can't hack the city. they are called ""sotos"" ""(?)"" or ""(?)"" or ""hercules"". all i know is this morning, i saw the seagulls flying above me, and from there the day moved along peacefully. and here in the studio, i'm singing tunefully to the music of jim and di and me, joyfully. we took a break, went out for dinner. the waitress asked the guy at the table how he was doin'. said ""the world's all messed up, but me, i'm doin' fine.""",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-couch-potato-lyrics,0.104,0.83,0.066,0.934,0.519
Sun Kil Moon,L-48,I Also Want to Die in New Orleans,2019,"this morning i woke up to the sound of birds chirping. at some point later today. i'll hear the kids from the school outside play. on the playground. since 1994, i've been in the same apartment building. living up on the third floor. if i spent my entire day never leaving the house. those sounds would inspire me to write about my past and my future and my now. yeah its an old elementary school. and i've been wondering what the kids from twenty to twenty-five years ago are doing now. yeah, from my living room i can see the school on washington. and the san francisco bay and russian hill and golden gate bridge. and my home is maybe only eight or nine hundred square feet. i know it may not sound like much for a retirement plan but i'd be happy to live here for the rest of my life. if i passed away to the sound of those kids playing on the playground. and this apartment's so rich with memories of friends and lovers who have come and gone. and beautiful music that's been written and recorded here. and so many christmas's spent with my cat pink. and with you, my dear. that would be as peaceful of a way to go as i can think of. my only hope is that i die before my girlfriend does. because she's so much stronger than me. her beside me while i go is how i'd like it to be. every day of my life an adventure. i was in the studio about a month ago with a few musicians over the winter. and had to take some guitars out of some soft cases in my apartment. put the guitars that i wanted to take to the studio inside of them. to lighten my travel. one of the guitars that i took out of the cases was a 1930s gibson l-48. tobacco sunburst, arched top with f holes. i bought it at a garage sale when i was in the seventh grade. for sixty dollars. i never loved the sound of it and found it to be thin. but i remember working with a great engineer over twenty years ago. his name was mark needham. who did lots of records with chris isaak. who also recorded my album songs for a blue guitar. he told me its only the f hole style guitars that leave a lot of room for vocals. so i took his advice at the time and opted for a cheaper version of the l-48. it had a fuller sound and it was painted blue. anyhow yesterday after a five day trip filming the tour documentary. down the coast of california seeing the grey whales surface along highway 1 between loan park and la. my engineer and i flew back up to san francisco from la. to transfer the film and audio files and label what we filmed between chico and la. we finished all that by 10:10 pm and i told nathan. i want to record some guitar music for an hour before we finished that day. the closest guitar i could find was leaning behind my chair in the bedroom. it was a gibson l-48. i have no memories of ever recording with that guitar before. but it did make the cover of ""songs for a blue guitar"". for the tortoise shell pick guard, completely disintegrated. i improvised to their guitar parts for an hour. and the guitar actually resonated nicely. nathan and i agreed it had been a long day. but we would pick things up again after tomorrow after meeting for lunch at my cafe. tomorrow is right now and as i'm finishing writing these words before nathan shows up. i can still hear the birds and my ears are still slightly ringing from this l-48 and there couldn't be a more peaceful way to start a day of singing",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-l-48-lyrics,0.11,0.864,0.026,0.974,0.542

Sun Kil Moon,This Is My Dinner,This Is My Dinner,2018,"arrived last night to the dark city of oslo. along the highway to the hotel, ben pointed out the snow. i stepped outside, and the cold air pinched my nose. i recalled the many times i've come here before to play shows in oslo. and in all of those times there are so many positive associations. even when i playing the so what club with my old band, the red house painters. and my times playing here solo acoustic. there was always a tall redhead guy following me around. the king of convenience. and i remember taking off from the venue with a blonde. and her boyfriend came knocking on the back door. out for my blood. and she sent me out the front door fast. and i went running down the cold street. watching over my shoulder, my heart was pounding fast. i was worried for my life. and i was young and i was single and i have no regrets about it. when you're in your twenties, in my opinion, nothing should be off limit. i don't really know what her boyfriend's problem even was. it's not like something threatening was going on. she was just jerkin' me off while i watched her suck my thumb. the most memorable drive i ever had in my life was from bergen to oslo. there were no signs of life. now and then, just a single bird or a boat. and the ominous silver-black mountains. off in the distance along the water. and in that moment i knew why norway had the market on black mountains. i'm pretty sure the movie trolls was filmed in that area, from what i can remember. but its scenic beauty could never be captured in pictures. every time i play in norway, it's been a special time. i played all the cities in norway. not just bergen and oslo, but also trondheim. actually, there are a few that i don't love that much if you'll allow me to be candid. the city of tonsberg and the city of stavanger. too many dudes with their eyes glued to their phones. i remember telling them the importance of relationships. but it seemed low on their priority lists. my worst memory of norway was playing a festival in giske. i got a call that my cat lost her ability to walk. and she was very sick. and i loved that cat more than anything in the world. she shared my bed with me for sixteen years. she was my little baby girl. so i booked a flight out of the island of giske. with hopes of getting home in time to see my kitty cat. before she took her last breath. the whole thing was so upsetting. and the anxiety was building up so badly on the plane. and i kept writing in my journal, “please pink, don't die on me. please pink don't die on me. please pink don't die on me when i'm up there in the sky. i'll hate myself forever if i could not kiss you goodbye”. but she waited for me, when i got to my house. she was laying there lifeless on the couch. i told her how much she meant to me, and all the joy she had given me. if there's a god up there, i pray to him that she heard me. and of course, how could i forget my visits to dreamlike ǻlesund. everyone asks me, “mark, who's the girl in the song?”. she knows who she is, and to reveal it would spoil it. leave the song alone, don't ask questions about it. leave the song alone, make your own connections with it. leave the song alone, don't ever try to overanalyze it. leave the song alone, don't dissect it like a dead frog. leave the song alone. . i got a lot of friends in norway. and i have to say my heart was broken when i heard about the guy who bombed oslo. and killed the little children on their summer vacation. people in america complained about his sentence being so light. but this shit happens every week in my country. so your country is doing something right. i hate to bring this subject up. ‘cause it causes my stomach to get sick and uptight. my point is that norway is peaceful. and you're doing something right. i love so many things about norway, and how they do christmas right. the candelabra in the window, it's so subtle at night. when i tell scandinavians how good they've got it. they just roll their eyes and say. “but it's so dark through the winter and it gets very depressing”. i'm gonna tell you something norway, and this is no lie. i've traveled all around the world and norwegians have the most beautiful eyes. the only thing i know that had more beautiful eyes than you. was my precious little cat, her eyes were green and blue. i miss you to death, but i want to thank promoter brent jacobs. my friend from norway. he's a caring and very thoughtful person. he's the one who arranged the flight to san francisco for me. out of the island of giske. so i could get home and see my cat and give her one last kiss. and i even remember a time when i played this exact same venue. some guy in the back seat got up and shouted. “mark, i got something to tell you”. i said, “okay, what is it?” and he said, “i hate your fucking guts”. and he rushed off in a huff. i told him, “when you leave and you're crossing the street, i hope you get hit by a bus”. you gotta understand, he insulted me first. and on tour, i don't sleep much. you gotta understand what i said, that was not me. we all have our moments and that guy was sniffing glue. and i was high on sleep deprivation. anyhow, i'm over it, i love you all and that's no lie. of all the countries i've played. yours is the most organized. and the fjords are so beautiful and the salmon melts in your mouth. and the girls are so stunning. even the three i met in stavanger, down south. there is one i'll never forget, how could i not remember?. she promoted my show and she showed me a snickers bar. and she said, “i'm so fucking broke, this is my dinner"". i said, “if you like, i could give you a few hundred norwegian kroner”. she said, “no ethically, i couldn't take your money mark”. and that was the last time that i ever saw her. and my favorite memory of norway was playing the garage in bergen. there was an old man running the place named dennis and we got to talking. he had a contagious smile. and we shared a bottle of sparkling water and a loaf of bread. it really wasn't much of a conversation. it was more like a one-sided monologue from dennis. and i listened very close. ‘cause dennis was older and wiser than me. i believe his last name is reckston. he doesn't have facebook and neither do i. so if you see him, please tell him mark kozelek said “hi, and god bless him”. and thank you oslo and norway for coming out tonight. we're happy to be here. playing music for you on this cold november night. sharing music with you, this is what i dreamed of all my life",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-this-is-my-dinner-lyrics,0.146,0.742,0.112,0.888,0.517
Sun Kil Moon,This Is Not Possible,This Is My Dinner,2018,"if you're traveling with the band and you get to frankfurt. and there's an icy feeling there and your feelings can get hurt. we got to the venue and asked the guys, “is our equipment here?”. and they said, “this is not possible”. we said, ""well, it's cold outside and it's raining cats and dogs. can we at least come inside and eat a frankfurter hot dog?"". we asked them ""is this at all remotely plausible?”. and they said, “this is not possible”. i said, “but we need to rehearse and a few of these guys just met. we need to get to know each other, and it's cold outside and  it's wet”. they said, ""hey, we're not your promoter, he's on vacation. i'm a bartender, he's a bouncer and the merch girl's stuck at the train station"". i say, “hey, we can roll with this. but could you please be the slightliest bit hospitable?"". they said, ""what do you mean, 'roll with this'?. are you from california, dude?"". we said, ""no, we were just wondering. if you could be the slightliest bit more affable?"". and they said, “this is not possible”. so we said, “fuck you guys, this has been a waste of our time”. and so we headed out of that dreary-ass place. may i suggest a place when you're jet-lagged as hell?. it's twenty minutes outside of frankfurt. it's called the romantik hotel in the suburb of frankfurt in a place called schloss rettershof. that's right the romantik hotel in schloss rettershof. schloss rettershof. in schloss rettershof. the romantik hotel in schloss rettershof. there are goats and sheeps and horses outside. and the lady at the desk is very polite. we said, ""we know we're here early but can we possibly. get into our rooms early, if it's not too much trouble?"". and she said, ""yes, this is possible"". we go to lunch and the waiter brings three type of salts. and he politely and eloquently describes them all. i said, “could i possible get a decaffeinated coffee with cream?”. he said, “americano, espresso, latte, what do you mean?”. i said, “i mean a decaffeinated coffee with cream”. and he said, “yes, this is possible”. i went to bed, and i was so tired i slept past 9 pm. i went to the front desk and she said, “i'm sorry, you missed your dinner. the restaurant is closed sleepy man”. i said, “but you don't understand, i traveled a very long way from the usa. can you please check with your kitchen and see what they say?”. and the guy from the kitchen came out and said, “sure, i remember you. you're the guy who likes the tagliatelle”. i said, ""yeah, that's me, thanks for remembering, i'm the guy who likes the tagliatelle"". i said, “could i please order it again?”. and the chef said, “yes, this is possible”. i woke up an hour or two late and my band members seemed moderately hostile. i said, “we gotta get to the road to holland. but i'm hungry, do you mind if i eat as quick as possible?"". they said, ""sure, but we're late, but i guess your request is totally reasonable”. and they said to me, ""mark, yes this is possible"". i asked a waiter, ""could i please get a glass of water?"". and he said, ""perhaps you'd like sparkling or a still in a large bottle?"". i said, “sparkling please, if it's not too much trouble"". and he said, “of course not, yes this is possible"". and when we arrived in utrecht, the hotel was delightful. not like the one the put us in in frankfurt, a youth hostel. i asked the front desk, ""could i please get a few extra blankets, and maybe a pillow?"". and the she said, ""yes, this is possible"". and late at night we went on a hunt for food. the place had many things to choose from. burgers and shawarmas and falafels. i said, ""can i possibly get some fries and a falafel?”. and the man said, ""yes, this is possible”. and after i ate my falafel my stomach felt awful. i asked the front desk lady if she had some pepto-bismol. she said, “well we have the dutch version but i have to warn you it tastes very awful"". i said, “that's no problem. can i have some, please?"". and she said, ""yes, this is possible”. as they say, ""when in holland, do the like the dutch"". so i went to the henhouse to feel a hen's touch. i said, ""could i possibly buy an hour of your time, if it's not too much trouble?”. and the hen said, ""yes, this is possible"". so the moral of the story is that in the country of holland. whatever you ask for, they say ""yes, it's possible"". but in the city of frankfurt, whatever you ask for they say “this is not possible”. but in the city of rettershof right outside of frankfurt. there is a peaceful hotel that is amiable and comfortable. i recommend it highly, take your girlfriend there for a week. it's dreamlike and magical and serene and quaint. now if germany calls and says “would you guys like to come over here and play a festival?"". i'd say, ""sure, if you could put my band in the romantik hotel in schloss rettershof"". but if germany says, “well mark, this is not possible”. then i'm gonna say, “sorry, this is not possible"". but if they call and ask me to see if i want to play in berlin again. of course i'm gonna say, “yes, this is possible"". is it possible that my favorite lou reed album is berlin?. yes, this is possible. is it possible that the band berlin wrote a song called ""sex"". that gave me a raging boner when i was 15?. yes, this is possible. is it possible that my favorite jonathan richman song is called ""hospital""?. yes, this is possible. is it possible that j.d. salinger wrote my favorite novel?. yes, this is possible. is it possible that my favorite meal is chicken and waffles?. this is not possible. is it possible that the united states president needs to be admitted into a mental hospital?. yes, this is possible. is it possible that i'm singing this song in berlin in front of thousands of people tonight?. this is not possible. is it possible that i'm actually in the studio in the tenderloin in san francisco in the studio singing to jim on drums, ramon on guitar, jeff on bass, chris on keyboards, with nathan behind me engineer and i'm in a vocal booth. yes, this is possible",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-this-is-not-possible-lyrics,0.108,0.86,0.032,0.968,0.538
Sun Kil Moon,Linda Blair,This Is My Dinner,2018,"seat 2c, oslo to warsaw, norwegian air. it's 9am and i'm yawning. next to a perky young girl with beautiful long blonde hair. she's playing a game on her phone and chewing on her danish. the little girl behind me has a demonic cough. and she sounds like linda blair in the exorcist. ""blaaaaagh! blaaaaagh! blaaaaagh! blaaaaagh! blaaaaagh! blaaaaagh! blaaaaaaaaaagh!"". i hope it's just a common cold and nothing too serious. if it's a serious medical condition, i hope the lord blesses her. last time i played poland was with justin from godflesh. i couldn't pronounce the name of the town to save my life or the venue. but we headlined a metal fest. the names of the other bands i don't know. but i do remember the aggressive sound of their names. cryptdeath motheroffuck lord fuck lord fuck lord. blaaaaagh!. i don't know much about poland, other than andrew golota's boxing style. he put his left jab out like a kitten trying to paw a bed sheet hanging out to dry. and his glass chin a very easy target to find. he quit after round two with mike tyson. he was on his ass, his eyes bulging with fright. and lennox lewis dropped him in round one. he looked like a kid getting knocked on his ass by his daddy. when his daddy came home drunk. but i have a soft spot for andrew because the great fighters, he never dodged. and i thought it was mean how his fans pelted him with garbage. during his walkout after he lost to mike tyson. facing tyson was a very brave thing to do. yea, he was overmatched. but i found the audience's behavior after the fight disgraceful and rude. though our local sports heroes are often times flawed, show them love and support. be kind, take the high road, be a good sport. i think in that tyson fight, golota's brains might have become unglued. he wasn't quite the same after that. it could have been that beating he took, i have no clue. but those people throwing things at him. was despicable and bullying at its worst. he was fighting mike tyson and representing your country. and his fans added humiliated him by adding  hurt to his already hurt. and yeah, when lennox dropped him in round one. i felt an even stronger connection with golota. ‘cause he went out there determined as raging bull, but like a lamb he got slaughtered. his weakness was that chin and that clumsy left. and those low blows, tourettic bull were his only weapon. his only defense, he was clearly overmatched. he is imperfect, as we all are. let's face it, we're all scared little girls and boys. so everybody right now, for andrew golota, make some fucking noise. so right now, for andrew golota, make some fucking noise. other than andrew golota, i don't know much about poland. i'm told my ancestors were from there, and i guess that's saying something, i know. i gotta admit, i never looked too deeply into it. though i'm told, before my name became kozelek apparently it was actually koziołek. and there was a time that i played the off festival in the summer in katowice. i played a seated venue. and a polish woman cooked italian food for me. and i've been to italy more times than i could ever count. and that polish woman cooked the best lasagna i ever had. and that's no fucking joke. but i shared a taxi to the airport with owen ashworth . i said, ""owen, did you ever notice how much poland looks like ohio?"". he said, ""yeah, it does"" and that's all he said. owen ashworth is a great songwriter from chicago, illinois if you never heard of him. now everybody that shows some gratitude for the beautiful things in the world. the lovely cornfields along the highways and the meals that the kind people prepare for us. and the audience who come to our countries who play beautiful music for us. and the fans who come out to our shows and pay the ticket and pay attention and listen to us. we're in this life once, so let's absorb what's around us. and not make a fuss over the little things. we may live to be old or tomorrow we might get hit by a bus. i got a lot of love for all people. yeah, i got a lot of love, i got a lot of love, even for the imperfect low-blowing andrew golota. i got a lot of love for you, all you people here in warsaw, poland. if i gotta be honest, there's only one thing i'll tell you that i don't love at all. it's the music of steely dan, it makes my skin crawl. well i gotta be honest, there's another thing that i don't love at all. it's the music of the eagles. it makes me wanna put my fist through a wall. now i'm gonna mention a song that i love very much. ac/dc's ""a touch too much”. now i'm gonna mention a couple of songs that i love very much. neil young's ""harvest moon” and also ""after the gold rush”. now i'm gonna mention a song that i know we all love very very much. how can we not?. zz top, ""i ain't asking for much"". now i'm gonna mention a song by queen, that i love very much. ""find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love. find me somebody to love”. now i'm gonna mention another song by led zeppelin that we all love very much. ""a whole lotta love, baby baby baby babe, i got a whole lotta love, got a whole lotta love"". now i'm gonna mention a song from an album of mine that i know you all love very much. “i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity. i love you baby forever and beyond eternity”",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-linda-blair-lyrics,0.268,0.655,0.077,0.923,0.5955
Sun Kil Moon,Copenhagen,This Is My Dinner,2018,"seat 14c swiss air. on the way to copenhagen from baden switzerland. my favorite hotel in scandinavia is there. they know me by name. they say, “well hello mr. kozelek. of course your courtyard room is ready. we've already added your extra pillows and blankets”. last night's show in baden got me very sad and. even the promoter said the audience was not fully concentrated. but after the show a woman approached me. and said, “hey i think your voice is nice”. i said, “thank god for that ‘cause other than that i don't have a lot of options of thing to do in life”. i asked what she did for work there in baden. she said she work with kids who needed help with speech development. i said “i remember those kids from my elementary school”. someone would come by and knock on the door and excuse them from the room. she said, “i know it's still the same way and when they leave the room some of the kids laugh at them”. i said, “that stuff can scar you for life. i've got my own scars from my high school remedial reading classes. and i've carried them around an inferiority complex. will amount to the amount of my success no matter how many people tell me how talented i am, i still carry around that stigma. i still feel like the dumb kid in the remedial reading class”. so on and on we went with our conversation. it was blatant flirtation on her end though. it could have been my imagination. she said, “it's freezing out here; what are you doing later tonight?”. said, “going to my hotel. why? what are you doing later tonight?”. she said, “you see this guy here standing next to me?. i'm going home with him; i'm his wife”. and we laughed and i said, “you asked me first. it's not like i asked you to bed down with me tonight”. let's be clear i said “i was just asking, 'what are you doing later tonight' ”. she said “your interest are in what my plans are after one o'clock in the morning?”. i said, “look, you asked me first”. and then we laughed and i hugged them goodbye. and i said, “i better get inside before i get pneumonia”. . so here we are on our way to copenhagen. in that city for whatever reasons i've had the most threesomes. but lots of girls come to copenhagen from trains from far away places. and the line that i always use is exactly the same. i said, “i got a cozy bed back at my hotel that will fit three”. and they said, “mmm, okay. let's go”. my visits there have been brief. and the threesomes are the fondest memories. but the most tender is my first memory of ever coming here. i was standing malmö right across the water. we took a ferry to copenhagen. i met a girl outside a chinese restaurant. i asked her if she liked to join my band for dinner. and three days later she hitchhiked all the way to hultsfred form her hometown of mala. that was 1997 and 20 years have past. and she's got a child and a husband. and i'm happy to say she's still one of my very dear friends. i'm still on this plane to copenhagen. and when i get there i hope the snow is falling. it calms my nerves to watch it fall from my courtyard window. and i hope the canals are frozen. i prefer to see the bikes stuck in the ice. people cycle too fast on the bikes. jesus christ, scandinavians' mother fucking bikes. it's hard to explain all of you. because for you, your bikes are a common thing. bicycles moving so fast is not a common thing for me to deal with or for me to see. i'm always jet-lagged and edgy and sleep deprived on tour traveling from city to city. but my life is pretty good overall. so about my issues with your bicycles, upon me, take no pity. i'm gonna tell you something from the bottom of my heart. i'm not lying; my favorite place to tour is scandinavia and that's a fact. the trains are peaceful the scenery is serene. the promoters are honest and they always put in the scandi. and your english skills are fantastic. and your eye's are are all cat-lined, spell-binding, hypnotic. yea, so this plane's about to land and i'm looking forward to this show in copenhagen. i need to close my eyes and spend five minutes tuning out in my loneliness. that's all i got to say that's all i'm saying that's all i'm saying. my eyes are now fading. but i'm looking forward to playing tomorrow night in copenhagen. and yea i'm older now and i won't end up in a threesome. i'll end up back in my hotel after the show in my middle aged lonesome. which is better for me ‘cause i need my sleep. it's just nice to call my girlfriend and tell her i love her and hear her say that she loves me too. but if i may gloat for just a moment. somebody told me in 1999 that i was indie rocks' answer to wilt chamberlain. back then i was 32, what he said was probably true. back then i was getting more pussy than all the guys in mew if they lived 20 lifetimes times two. now i can barely get it up. and i'm just happy to be singing up here for you. to be honest my dick doesn't get hard as often anymore. is this too much information?. what's concerning for me with all those viagra commercials i used to ignore. now i'm starting to pay attention. . i think the woman next to me on the plane. thinks i'm a crazy man writing my long crazy man scroll. i just stop for a second to ask if she'd ever seen the norwegian boy from trolls. she said, “excuse me sir, i don't feel like talking right now; i'm very tired”. i said, “okay i understand, i'm sorry, but if you only knew who the fuck i am”. she said, “excuse me sir, your tone is very aggressive”. i'm fucking with ya'll right now. this conversation never even happened. now for real i'm putting away my crazy man scroll. this plane's about to land. i got to get up to use the bathroom. anyhow thank you for coming out to tonight's show in copenhagen. when i was a kid, some kids liked skoal but i preferred copenhagen when it came to my snuff. anyhow thank you again for coming out tonight to our show. i know what you're thinking this song's been long enough. but i can't go away without giving a shoutout to your great ex-boy boxer brian nielsen. look he will stop our boy from evander holyfield, iron mike tyson. let's give it up for denmark's brian nielsen. he wasn't much of a fighter. but he had the heart of a lion, brian nielsen. so lets give it up for denmark's brian nielsen. so lets give it up for denmark's brian nielsen",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-copenhagen-lyrics,0.14,0.804,0.056,0.944,0.542
Sun Kil Moon,Candles,This Is My Dinner,2018,"seat 12c sas copenhagen to stockholm. stockholm would be my first choice for a european second home. feel like i live there in another life. i dreamed that i lived in an old flat there once. and it was christmas time. in real life, i brought home a lot of nice gifts from sweden. a  from malmö and some ice-cube trays from ikea. and a collection of old silverware that an ex-girlfriend's father sold me from his antique shop. and she gave me a beautiful blue ceramic bowl that's still on my kitchen table. got a lot of good memories here in stockholm. last time i saw elliott smith was at the accelerator festival. july 5th 2000, a beautiful sunny day. i wish i would've hugged him goodbye. but i figured i'd see him again another day. maybe in san francisco or l.a. but as things turned out it didn't work out that way. and my favorite restaurant in stockholm, sweden. is right down the road. it's called pelican. i like the salmon but i never eat the reindeer. something about the idea of eating reindeer brings my eyes to tears. i don't understand how any of you can eat reindeer. when i was a little kid my favorite christmas special was rudolph the red nose reindeer. he had that stuff nose voice. and i still love rudolph. i saw a reindeer carpaccio on the menu recently. and i wanted to shoot myself. i love you sweden i really do. but please let the reindeer run free. for the sweetest animals kill  a moose or a buffalo. if that's what you gotta do to taste gamey meat. please leave the reindeer alone. please pass on that reindeer dish. please do it for me. please grant me this one wish. please leave the reindeer alone. please pass on that reindeer dish. please do it for me. please grant me just this one wish. the first time i ever played stockholm. a kid walked up to me on stage. and said, “mark, do you realize that you are god in sweden?”. i said, “you're very young and that's a foolish thing for you to say and you're tripping. like i said you're young. you're gonna see that somebody else is gonna come along and be god in sweden”. and later on came josé gonzález and sigur rós. if i die tomorrow, i'll be blurbs on online magazines for 48 hours. you'd all be fine, you'd say, “hey i met him once and he didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me”. then you'd say, “look who's headlining at roskilde? the gorillas”. so back to sweden and all the things i love about it. a good friend is here and i always make time for her. when she sees me i think something about me makes her glow. and when i see her something about her makes me glow. she's one of those friends i'll always know. she uplifts me and i uplift her. and that's an essential part of being on the road and being on tour. so much stress on the road and it can make you edgy. so surround yourself with the people who care about you and make you happy. who don't bring you down and who love you unconditionally. as my lawyer says, “never engage with crazy”. and isaiah says, “to further yourself you gotta step over the dead bodies”. there is something to me about how sweet to me that is meditative. everyone seems like they're on some kind of sedative. when i was a kid i loved . and  valium. when i'm in sweden, i kinda feel like i'm on 5mg of valium. because the swedish people, they seem like they're on valium. or they smoked a little bit of pot. it's in their eyes, they look so tranquil. they're like cats they don't blink a lot. don't know if it's the darkness or if it's the things that they're eatin'. there's a serenity i feel whenever i'm in sweden. i like the candles in the doorways of the hotels. i like the candles on their dinner tables. you guys put candles everywhere. you even put them in the hotel elevators. that's one of my favorite favorite things about sweden. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. the candles. ‘cause when i was a kid my dad wouldn't let me burn candles. i'd light incense or candles in my room. and my dad would walk up and say. “goddamnit mark, put those fucking candles out. you're gonna burn the whole goddamn house down”. and let me tell you a story. my dad turned out to be right. later on in 2004 i left a candle burning beside a flower pot. it was the summer and all of the flowers were dried up. i went for a walk to the marina and back. but when i was gone, those flowers went up. and when i came home, my door was all boarded up with firewood. i broke it down, it looked like my whole apartment floor was covered in charcoal. and i looked around and my whole kitchen wall was gone. some guys were doing construction in the building next door. and they saw the fire and they called the fire department. luckily for me the fire department is two blocks away from my apartment. so they came and they put the fire out. had they not been there to see it. i would surely be doing theater for a licenses in san quentin prison. burning an apartment down and killing a few people in america. that's called third degree murder. that's when you kill somebody for negligence. and being careless. i used to get pissed off at my dad when he'd tell me what to do. and he'd have a fit. but as it turns out with the candles he was not clowning around. he was right and not wrong. i was spaced out my head was in the clouds. and i almost burned my whole apartment building down. but the swedes seemed to be in control of the candle situation. the swedes are smarter and more organized than americans. i know this isn't much of a song and the ending is even worse. it could've been better. but stewardess came around and just told me to shut my laptop off. i have more things to say in regards to how much i love stockholm. and all the things i love about it besides candles and more clocks and doff blue ceramic bowls. but like i said, the stewardess came by and said, “sir, please put your laptop away”. i said, “jesus christ, what the fuck?. i've got this huge concert tonight in stockholm. and i have this perfect song i was going to sing to my audience”. she said, “sir, please put it away now”. i say “okay, goddamnit”. and i close my laptop down. and that's my unfinished song. from seat 12c scandinavian airlines copenhagen to stockholm. and this is my unfinished song. from seat 12c scandinavian airlines copenhagen to stockholm. and this is my unfinished song. from seat 12c scandinavian airlines copenhagen to stockholm. and this is my

Sun Kil Moon,Soap for Joyful Hands,This Is My Dinner,2018,"walked back to the hotel last night, tired as hell with my band. madrid was canceled, yeah. even with all those allegedly competent stage hands. they couldn't fix the calibration on the pa system. and the snare drum was missing. and an amplifier was blown. and the feedback wouldn't stop hissing. they talked in spanish, i gave them two chances to fix the thing. but they scratched their heads, and among themselves. they kept whispering and whispering. i asked a band member who understands a little bit of spanish, “what are they saying?”. he shook his head and said, “don't think this show is happening”. got into my hotel room and i called caroline, back in the states. she was cooking a turkey with her parents in la, it was thanksgiving day. though i was tired, i spent some time blow drying my socks. that i washed in the sink a few v-neck t-shirts and a pair of pants. with some hotel hand soap, the wrapper said “soap for joyful hands”. i went and laid down, under the thin sheets of my spanish bed. fell asleep and had a dream about the twin sisters. whom outside the venue i met. it would have been great to slay the crowd. to thrown down on that stage. but it could not be done with that old dusty outdated pa system. dialed in for performance art and children's plays and stand-up comedians and magicians. it was not dialed in for dynamic bands who play a few decibels above medium. before i went to sleep, i called all the guys in my band. about the lobby call in the morning and the basic layout of tomorrow's plans. what time do we leave for oporto? when will the plane land?. my socks were hanging out to dry on the doorknobs, the curtain rods, on the bedsides stands, even on the lamps. washed with madrid tap-water and “soap for joyful hands”. seat 9c, iberia air, al oporto to heathrow via madrid. last night, we played in a town called espinho outside of oporto, portugal. our hotel was on the beach and the air smelled so, so wonderfully tide pool-y. i went for a walk along the rocks that went straight out into the ocean. and the rocks started getting slippery. when i got to the edge, i was about to take a photo with my disposable camera. when a sneaker wave came out of nowhere and i got hammered. i walked back to the hotel, drenched with ocean and tide pool in my mouth. getting drenched by that water out of nowhere, for me, that's what's life's all about. and i even love the routine stuff, the day-to-day-to-day-to-day-to-day. i find poetry in the day-to-day. i find it in the emptiest, loneliest, most boring, and uneventful days. but it's the curveballs that hit us out of nowhere that make us say. ""fuck, thank god i'm alive today!. thank god i'm alive to taste the ocean today!. thank god i'm alive to smell the fish soup and boiled shrimp today!"". that sneaker wave woke me up and made me realize what a gift i've been given in life. i've got friends who didn't get this far because they committed suicide. i've got friends who didn't get this far because they had heart attacks and fell off the couch and died. i've got friends who didn't get this far because of cancer, they died. that sneaker wave woke me up and made me realize. what a beautiful gift i've been given. one day i'll wake up in stockholm snow. and one day i'll wake up to the sunshine in portugal. came back to my still-wet clothes. washed with “soap for joyful hands” and spanish water. and hung them to dry on the balcony of the hotel on shirt hangers. i went to play the show in espinho and we sang ""i love portugal, i love portugal”. i told them the story of the first time we played there in the 90's with the red house painters. when we played soul coughing last minute at a festival. and how we got whistled at and pelted by garbage thrown at us by the fans. and how it made me smile like satan, how i met two guys named vasco and miguel. who became my very good lifelong friends. after the show last night in espinho i met a woman who asked. “mark, besides music, what are your other passions?”. i said, “i'm fifty years old, baby, i find laying on the couch very relaxing. and i also enjoy reading books with my new reading glasses. and i enjoy being 50, and not suffering from pancreatic cancer. and i enjoyed waking up after being anesthetized from a colonoscopy and finding out i didn't have colon cancer. you want to know what my other passions besides living my dream of playing my music?. those are your answers”. she said, “i just mean other passions, you know, things besides playing music, dude”. i said, “if i put any effort into other passions. i'd not be here standing in portugal, talking to you"". i said, “do you get what i'm saying?. if i had any other passions like dairy farming or freeing animals from the zoo. i'd not be standing here right now in espinho, portugal talking to you”. she said, “i'm not sure if you know what i mean. when i ask you if you have other hobbies or passions”. i said, “look, there are three things i do. i play music and eat and i watch boxing matches. to do what i do for a living, baby, other passions would be called distraction. having other passions would make me one of those hobbyist musicians who takes twenty years to make four lousy albums”. it was raining outside and i said, “hey, it's been a nice conversation, but i gotta get going”. and i got in the van with my band and we went to the hotel by the ocean. and i was like, “fuck, my socks are still wet”. the socks i washed with “soap for joyful hands"". and now they're even more drenched the oporto rain. and i was like, “fuck, god damn"". now i made my madrid connection. with my plastic bag of wet socks in my luggage bag. on my way to heathrow and when my plane lands. going right for the hotel room to hang my socks to dry and wash with “soap for joyful hands”. now i'm on my way to heathrow and when my plane lands. gonna pray that my socks washed with “soap for joyful hands”. are dry for my show at shepherd's bush tomorrow night. because i don't feel like going to westfield mall. and shopping for socks. god, i hate that fucking place. it reminds me of being a kid when i was small and falling to my knees and going. “mom, let's go home, i'm fucking bored!"". i know you're all thinking, “what's the big deal?. just go to h&m and buy some new socks”. but maybe you don't think like i do, you see, i'm very sentimental about my socks. they're christmas gifts from my sister and from my father and my ex-girlfriend's grandmother. and there's a pair that in oslen, norway i bought. i'm very sentimental about my socks. i wanna sleep tomorrow until 3:30 in the afternoon. i'm fucking tired and i need some serious fucking sleep. i've been to fourteen different countries in the last three weeks. not for the money, not for the ego trip, not for the potential after-show action. i'm here right now because this is my passion. i'm up here right now in front of you. not because of the decision i made to become a musician. if i wasn't doing this, what else would i be doing?. do i strike you as a man who would be english teaching?. i'm on airplanes every fucking day. trying to get from amsterdam to helsinki to espinho to  to warsaw to oslo to copenhagen to dublin to tel aviv to reykjavik to athens. because baby, let me tell you something, this is my one life's passion. and if that girl i met in portugal was here, i think she'd say. ""well, i think i've tapped into one of your other passions. you're on some trip about socks, and it's totally neurotic"". i'd say, “yea, whatever you say, but look i wrote a song about it. a captivating song about washing socks in hotel sinks. who else can give you that? graham nash, steely dan, or ed sheeran, glenn hansard?. the only guy in this whole world who could write a poetic song about cheap hotel soap is jonathan richman. but it wouldn't be quite like mine, because i'm a unique motherfucker from a town in ohio called massillon. nobody can catch the poetry in washing socks with hand soap at hotels like i can. you see asking me, 'mark, what are your other passions?'. would be like me asking leonardo dicaprio. 'hey leo, what are your other passions besides acting?'. he'd call his agent and say. 'please remove this person, he's breaking my concentration'. now have i made my point? i hope so. and when my plane lands, i hope my socks are dry overnight. that i washed with “soap for joyful hands”. and when my plane lands, i hope my socks will dry overnight. for tomorrow i have a show in shepherd's bush that i washed with wintery tap-water and “soap for joyful hands”. and when my plane lands, i hope my socks are dry overnight. that i washed with “soap for joyful hands”. and when my plane lands, i hope my socks will dry overnight. for tomorrow night's show at shepherd's bush that i washed with “soap for joyful hands” and madrid tap-water. and when my plane lands. and when my plane. and when my plane lands. and my plane lands. and when my plane lands",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-soap-for-joyful-hands-lyrics,0.188,0.763,0.049,0.951,0.5695

Sun Kil Moon,The Possum,Universal Themes,2014,"yesterday, i was working in my yard when i saw a possum. swinging in the foothills and he was old and beat up and hobbling. i got a closer look and his foot was mangled. i was woken up earlier by what i thought was a cat tangle. but it was him who got it bad from the cat that night. he moved slowly down the hill when he slipped under the fence. i propped myself up to check him out and he found nook under the air conditioner. i pointed him out to caroline and she crouched down and he was shaking and full of fear. and when she stood up, i asked, ""baby, why are you crying?"". she said, ""because he's cute and he's down there and he's dying"". i went up to my room and i got a call from justin. he was in san francisco and godflesh was playing. caroline drove me halfway there where i met tony. and we drove to the city and we parked out in front of the dna. justin and us, we had some laughs and we took photographs backstage. and our guts were protruding in all of them and we just kept laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing and laughing. and when godflesh took the stage, tony and i, we stood there floored. drum machines hammered and feedback blazed. and for a moment, everybody grew silent. while justin tuned his guitar; like a church, it got so quiet. just for a minute, and then they all soared together. like a car off a cliff, they crashed and burned over and over and again and again. they threw hard vicious guttural b-flats that shook their opponent. like a tough roberto ""hands of stone"" durán, seventh round. davey moore june 16, 1983. godflesh shook the ramp that night like an early mark “gator” rogowski. justin lunged at the mic like a hungry great white. he was on fire, giving everything he had and killing it that night!. tearing at his prey and then it came to a screeching halt. a relentless and beautiful and glorious 70 minute assault. and then he bowed down and set his seven string electric guitar down. and it screeched to holy hell and they disappeared and off went the crowd. then we had pizza and i came back to my apartment in the city. until 4am, i watched movies and my ears were ringing. and i called caroline out at the house. and we talked about the concert and about the possum down in the nook. and the ocean air came through my window. and the sound of foghorns, and then when i awoke. godflesh was down in la. and tony had an open house that day. and i looked out at sausalito. and caroline was on her way back from lake tahoe. i got a call from paolo sorrentino. i'd be off to switzerland in a week or so. caroline came home that night and we had dinner and watched hbo. and i'm grateful for her love and for my friends. and to have seen the possum walk its last walk among the ivy. i want to grow old and to walk the last walk. knowing that i, too, gave it everything i got. against all roadblocks and obstacles i fought. for to live another day is much better than to not. and i'd like to die with music in my ears. the piano of maurice ravel or godflesh's guttural growls from hell. the sound that evokes good memories of being young and able to get around. and i'd like caroline beside me. that old possum lost the fight. his sad, black eyes; what a thing to see on a glowing easter sunday. but that rodent was loved and he's still thought of. and church bells rang that day. i remember hearing them in the afternoon just as we left. he had to have heard them too",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-the-possum-lyrics,0.233,0.684,0.083,0.917,0.575

and i'm here until june 9th. got some scenes this week, which is great, because at this point i'm losing my fucking mind. never mind all the other verses i've written about switzerland. there's new things going on in my life, like my girlfriend got a new kitten. and a friend of mine gave out my number to some crazy motherfucker. and i got all pissed off and she said, ""who do you think you are, mick fucking jagger?"". i fell asleep last night in new orleans. just back from switzerland, where like i said, i was going insane. and i went and got oysters on the half shell and some blackened

tel-aviv. and it concerned me cause i've got friends over there. when i talk to them on the phone i can hear it in their voice that they're scared. some shit went down on tour and i had to let go one of my band guys. and it hurt me so much that for a solid forty-five minutes i cried. came to my room and he said, ""mark, i really needed this job"". i said, ""it's tough love my friend, take some time off and we'll make music again one day i promise"". got back from europe and it was labor day and i went walking. and i laid in the sun all day and i called my friend jude and we got to talking. jude's the widow of my old friend, tim. i said, ""whatever you do, please, don't ask me about switzerland"". then my dad called about someone we love. i put a check in the mail, gotta do what i gotta do when push comes to shove. i hear her voice sometimes and it's an octave higher. cause she gets weak from the drugs that dehydrate her. it's hard to handle but i just keep keeping busy. traveling and playing and writing 'til i'm fucking dizzy. some people love what i do and some get fucking pissy. but i don't give a fuck, one day they're all gonna miss me. one year ago i was in a car with a handicapped kid. i said, ""so what are you gonna do with your life?"" and he sat there blank. and i said, ""okay you think about it a minute"". and a few minutes passed and i said, ""so what are you gonna do with your life, it's been a minute"". and he said, ""i'm just gonna, i'm just gonna, i'm just gonna, i'm just gonna live it"". i'm going to sleep tonight and i can't fall asleep. listening to the high pitched foghorns of the carquinez strait. they sound like a cacophony of piccolos and flutes, they echo all night. and i just turned forty-eight and i spent seventeen grand on the mayweather-pacquiao fight. going to sleep tonight with a goddamn ear infection. i broke another tooth on a piece of hard bread, and my gums are fucking hurting. and my friend ben went on a 50k race and he broke his wrist. and he called me up the other day and he asked me to join him as his guitarist. to play with him in san francisco, february 23rd. and i said, ""yes, sir, thank you, have a good day, sir"". so, i played last night with ben at the swedish american hall, and, man, i was so nervous that i was gonna hit the wrong guitar chords, but ben sang beautifully and everything fell together pretty well. what a nice combination that was; ben singing, me on guitar, and a great pianist named zac rae. caroline was there, and so was ben's girlfriend rachel. they both loved the show.. i talked to bob mould afterwards, and i told him about how me listening to candy apple grey on a sunny day at an old girlfriend's house made it into some lyrics, and i hoped that someday they'd make it into a song. it was a pretty funny night. earlier at dinner, i got picked on a little for still having a flip phone, but after the show some guy walked into the backstage area and was introduced to me as the smartest guy in the world. they said he was a physicist or something like that, and i pulled out my phone to check the time. he pulled his phone out and pointed out that he had the exact same phone that i did. everyone was laughing, and there was some girls looking at us like our phones were really gross or something. we were all getting pretty tired. ben and his friends took off.

Sun Kil Moon,Garden of Lavender,Universal Themes,2015,"was on a flight home from—well, it doesn't matter. with eleven hours, a million thoughts were gathering. my mind kept going to my garden of lavender. i wanted to get to them so they wouldn't die. when i got home, they were dry as wheat. while the vines thrived around them b-horror film green. not sure what my lavender symbolize. but inside my heart cried. my heart is drawn to the small out-of-the-way things. that i can't help but to give my focus and attention and care. cause they shut off what hijacks my brain. and help to tune out what can cause me pain. and i care for the animals around my yard. and my sister's children and i care for my garden. swarmed upon by bumblebees. and yellow jackets and wasps and hornets that can dart out and sting. i see the big orange tabby cat. getting warm on the cover of the hot tub. he turns over on his back. looking for a belly rub. i see the deer tracks in the snow. on the animal path. that leads into my backyard. i hear the sound of my girlfriend's car. coming up the driveway and it fills my heart. with joy. though i know it will all end someday. and someone else will be sleeping in my mountain house. wondering who lived here before. just like i sometimes do. though i never really cared to explore. i see the chocolate and peanut butter cat. i look at him and he looks back. i snap my fingers and blow him a kiss. he rubs his head against my hand and we reminisce. i walk downtown and see the christmas lights. along the highway and how they shine. and i'm reminded of when i was a child. and how happy i felt when i opened the box and saw a guitar inside. was on a flight to somewhere i can't remember. i feel like i've lived so many lives, i can't put it all together. dordrecht, holland, yeah that was it. i had a nice dinner with a concert promoter and his korean wife, suyoung kim. then dropped me off at an old spooky hotel. i felt like an old man in a castle looking over at the canal. and i went and i played for a crowd but my heart wasn't there. i came back to my room and slouched in my bed. and i fell asleep still stewing about my dried up lavender. and i fell asleep in the dark dead night. and i dreamed of a bluejay picking up a seed. and passing it to another's beak. then watched him soar to another branch. then a baby possum hissed at me as i crept up on him near a trash can. and i woke up one rainy morning in dordrecht, holland. then got on a flight for london, england. then i took a cab from heathrow right to westfield mall in shepherd's bush. where i bought a raincoat, then checked into the k west hotel. and ate at a polish restaurant down the street. i played the next night at shepherd's bush empire. neil halstead and his band were opening and their soundcheck sounded great. and as i watched i remembered playing with mojave 3 in the mid-'90s. one of the shows being at cmj in new york. and i remembered seeing them open for gomez in madrid in 1998. i was with my girlfriend marina but i somehow managed to sneak in an unforgettable kiss with rachel backstage. it was one of those kisses that you'll take to your grave. gomez knew i was there, and they played ""grace cathedral park"" that night and i got pretty choked up listening to them. so anyhow, i played my show at shepherd's bush that night and a fan heckled me asking if i really hated nels cline. i explained that i didn't, that his name just rhymed with one word or the other. after the show, i left with my agent, ed, and his wife, and alessia, and we talked for a bit. then i walked back to the k west with my guitar and got into my bed, called my girlfriend and fell asleep",https://genius.com/Sun-kil-moon-garden-of-lavender-lyrics,0.125,0.82,0.056,0.944,0.5345
