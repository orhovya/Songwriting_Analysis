Gregory Alan Isakov,The Trapeze Swinger,Others,2015,"please, remember me happily. by the rosebush laughing. with bruises on my chin, the time when. we counted every black car passing. your house beneath the hill. and up until someone caught us in the kitchen. with maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank. a vision too removed to mention. but please, remember me fondly. i heard from someone you're still pretty. and then they went on to say. that the pearly gates. had such eloquent graffiti. like ""we'll meet again"" and ""fuck the man"". and ""tell my mother not to worry"". and angels with their great handshakes. were always done in such a hurry. and please, remember me that halloween. making fools of all the neighbors. our faces painted white. by midnight, we'd forgotten one another. and when the morning came i was ashamed. only now it seems so silly. that season left the world and then returned. and now you're lit up by the city. so please, remember me mistakenly. in the window of the tallest tower. calling passers-by but much too high. to see the empty road at happy hour. gleam and resonate, just like the gates. around the holy kingdom. with words like ""lost and found"" and ""don't look down"". and ""someone save temptation"". and please, remember me as in the dream. we had as rug-burned babies. among the fallen trees and fast asleep. aside the lions and the ladies. that called you what you like and even might. give a gift for your behavior. a fleeting chance to see a trapeze. swinger high as any savior. but please, remember me, my misery. and how it lost me all i wanted. those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains. the colored birds above their running. in circles around the well and where it spells. on the wall behind st. peter. so bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint. ""who the hell can see forever?"". and please, remember me seldomly. in the car behind the carnival. my hand between your knees, you turned from me. and said, ""the trapeze act was wonderful. but never meant to last"", the clown that passed. saw me just come up with anger. when it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot. had an element of danger. so please, remember me finally. and all my uphill clawing. my dear, but if i make the pearly gates. i'll do my best to make a drawing. of god and lucifer, a boy and girl. an angel kissing on a sinner. a monkey and a man, a marching band. all around a frightened trapeze swinger",https://genius.com/Gregory-alan-isakov-the-trapeze-swinger-lyrics,0.211,0.687,0.103,0.897,0.554
